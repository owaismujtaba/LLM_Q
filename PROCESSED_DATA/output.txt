CORPORATE LAW AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE –
THE HUNGARIAN EXPERIENCE
BY ISTVÁN CZAJLIK AND JÁNOS VINCZE
Abstract
In this paper our aim was to establish legal facts for Hungary in detail,
to put the country’s situation into international context, and to find newavenues for comparative research. We updated investor protection indi-cators already existing in the literature, while determined enforcementindicators for the first time. We hypothesize that besides indicators thedynamics of legislation must be an important topic for research. Ananalysis of the dynamics of legislation in Hungary indicates that twotendencies could be observed. one responding to actual challenges,leading to more reliance on the interpretation of law by judges, the sec-ond following the German-tradition resulting in more bright line rules,and more complicated legal regulation. To make the former workablepolitical and financial independence is a necessary, though not suffi-cient, condition. We emphasize that though investor protection supportsthe supply of outside funds, there is a demand side to external finance,and more prudential regulation can lead to less demand for external fi-nance.

GAZDASÁGI JOG ÉS VÁLLALATIRÁNYÍTÁS – A MAGYAR TAPASZTALAT
Összefoglalás
Ebben a tanulmányban azt a célt t űztük magunk elé, hogy olyan “jogi
tényeket” határozzunk meg Magyarországra, amelyeket a gazdaság-irányítás és jog kapcsolatát vizsgáló irodalom fontosnak talált. Igyek-szünk az ország helyzetét nemzetközi kontextusba helyezni, és megpró-bálunk a további komparatív elemzések számára is új utakat találni.Felfrissítettünk az irodalomból már ismert „befektet ő védelmi” indiká-
torokat, és meghatároztunk olyan „jogalkalmazási mutatókat”, amelyektudomásunk szerint eddig nem voltak hozzáférhet őek az irodalomban.
Hipotézisünk az, hogy a további kutatás számára a jogalkotás dinami-kája nagyon fontosabb téma lehet. A magyarországi jogalkotás némelyszegmensének dinamikáját elemezve azt látjuk, hogy két egymással el-lentétesnek látszó tendencia látszik kirajzolódni. Egyfel ől a jog a gya-
korlat kihívásaira próbál meg válaszokat adni, amely sok esetben a tör-vények bírói interpretációjának viszonylag nagyobb szerepet ad, más-felől viszont jelen van a német jogi tradíció „öntörvény ű” jogi fejl ődése,
a reguláció komplexitásának növekedése, a jogi kiskapuk elkerülésénekigényével. Az els ő irány m űködőképességének biztosítá-sához a politi-
kától való függetlenség, illetve a pénzügyi függetlenség szükséges felté-telek Hangsúlyozzuk, hogy a befektet ők védelme ugyan növeli a válla-
latok számára elérhet ő küls ő források nagyságát, de van egy keresleti
oldal is, és az „er ősebb” szabályozás csökkentheti a küls ő források
iránti keresletet.

1 INTRODUCTION
Corporate governance is a relatively new concept. Its introduction manifests
that in the last decades economists have become aware of the difficulties ofdescribing and analyzing the behavior of firms in the traditional (neo-classical) framework, and expresses the theoretical and empirical interest ofthe profession. Zingales (1998) defines corporate governance as „the complexset of constraints that shape the ex-post bargaining over the quasi-rents gener-ated by the firm”, and gives three main reasons why corporate governancematters. First, corporate governance sets up ex ante  incentives, second, it al-
ters ex post  bargaining efficiency, and third, it allocates risks. Under the tra-
ditional approach to the theory of the firm, corporations are seen as simpledecision making entities with a well-defined goal, value maximization, whichthey can actually realize. The new approach claims that the way firms aremanaged is important from the point of view of economic and social out-comes, and governance can be improved via policy intervention. Interestingproblems with respect to the distribution of control rights, to the sharing ofprofits and quasi rents emerge, accordingly. A substantial body of literaturehas evolved around these issues, without having reached unanimously agreedupon solutions.
Corporate governance styles vary across and within countries. It is well es-
tablished today that mature developed economies are not monochromic intheir corporate governance structures, and the American (Anglo-Saxon),Japanese or German economies are characterized by their own corporate con-trol mechanisms. Empirical research on other countries has started to discoverthat the global experience is indeed multicolored (Shleifer–Vishny (1997).
Students of the evolution of economic institutions have pointed out that in-
stitutions are heavily influenced by history, there exists path dependence. Thismust be true with respect to corporate governance styles, as well. In the tran-sition economies of Eastern Europe this path dependence may have peculiarappearances, since here the former governance structures were connected tocentral planning, an economic framework abandoned around 1990 in this re-gion. Old styles of corporate control became quickly unviable, but their ves-tiges might have survived. A large literature has treated the problems of pri-vatization (both of banks and of non-financial corporations), bank consolida-tion (an issue that emerged in practically every transition country and had im-
4
portant relationship with corporate control), and the restructuring of enter-
prises. These issues are transitional problems, almost per se . After more than
a decade on the transition path the more developed transition economies havepractically finished with these issues, and have updated their corporate con-trol structures. Still the current mechanisms may significantly differ fromthose existing in mature market economies, despite being very much differentfrom their socialist forebears.
The problems of corporate governance are tightly interwoven with those of
corporate finance. As a move away from the Miller-Modigliani propositions ithas been found that financial contracts between enterprises and stakeholders(employees, owners, creditors, etc.) lie in the heart of the corporate govern-ance problem. These contracts determine to a large extent the framework ofcorporate governance, by creating incentives, and by setting the stage for bar-gaining processes. For instance, an alternative definition of corporate govern-ance in Shleifer–Vishny (1997) says that it „deals with the ways in whichsuppliers of finance to corporations assure themselves of getting a return ontheir investment”. It is then not surprising that the relationship between non-financial corporations and financial markets has also been found to be vari-able across the world. Rajan–Zingales (1996) shows that in countries wherefinancial markets are less developed sectors where external finance “shouldbe significant” have a definitely lower rate of growth than in countries withmore advanced financial markets. This finding can be construed as an indirectproof of the relevance of corporate control mechanisms, too.
By and large the corporate governance literature has been based on the as-
sumption that the main reason why corporate control is an issue is the incom-pleteness of financial contracting. With contracts incomplete, governancemechanisms have to be devised to fill in the gaps financial markets cannotdeal with. Thus corporate governance and financial markets work side byside, and in close interaction. Incomplete contracting provides a role for thelegal system, including both laws and enforcement, since laws regulate con-tracts, and enforcement entails their interpretation in the event of disagree-ments between contracting parties.
This observation launched a series of studies attempting to identify the rele-
vant features of typical legal systems, claiming that legal differences have re-sulted in important variation in financial sectors and corporate governancemechanisms across the world. La Porta et al (1997) introduced a set of legal
5
indicators in order to characterize the quality of investor protection, and
showed that countries where investors are less well protected by the legalsystem have smaller capital markets. La Porta et al. (1998) tried to trace backthe differences in legal protection to the legal origins of legal systems, and ar-gued, also, that differences in financial markets, due to different legal protec-tion, may have a large impact on the structure of ownership and on corporategovernance in general. More recently Pistor (2000) and Pistor–Raise–-Gelfer(2000) have extended this work to former socialist countries in a comparativeframework. The most important conclusion of this latter research stresses theimportance of enforcement. Whereas, La Porta et al. (1998) concludes thatbetter enforcement does not additionally contribute to financial market depthin their sample of 49 countries (not including any transition economies), Pis-tor-Raiser-Gelfer (2000) suggests  that among transition countries law en-forcement is probably a stronger determinant of investor protection than lawson the books. To substantiate this claim in a cross-country empirical study LaPorta-Lopez-de-Silanes-Shleifer (2003) examines whether private and publicenforcement of the law matters for security markets, and finds an affirmativeanswer.
It has also been realised that politics play an essential role in financial
development. In this spirit Rajan–Zingales (2001) proposes an „interestgroup” theory of financial development, as an alternative to the La Porta etal.’s (1998) “legal origin” theory. One can take, however, a more liberal viewon the theory of financial development. We regard theories as complementaryrather than competitive. The legal framework is certainly important forfinancial development, and it is possible that legal origins have long termeffects, the working of the legal system exhibits path dependence. On theother hand interest groups may play substantial roles in shaping both the legalsystem, and the financial architecture. Needless to say other factors (culture,language, religion) may be also important, as it has been suggested in theliterature. A priori it is hardly believable that one would have a single theorythat would enable us to explain all the specificities and properties of financialsystems and of corporate governance styles.  In this paper we focus on theinterrelationships between law and corporate governance in present-day Hun-gary, without endorsing the view that law is the main or even onlydeterminant of corporate governance.
Those authors who want to test broad theories must take a comparative ap-
proach, conducting empirical studies involving many countries. Certainly
6
there is room for individual country studies to check whether their conclu-
sions can stand up to closer scrutiny at the individual level. Our foremost goalis to establish legal facts for Hungary, and to find new avenues for compara-tive research. We find that some of details so far neglected are possibly im-portant, and it is imperative to emphasis the dynamics of legislation. It isworth to know which events and motives have shaped legal change in order to“forecast” developments in corporate control, and to give better policy advice.
In Section 2 a general overview of the character of Hungarian corporate law is
given. In Section 3.1 laws on the books are described, by specifying the val-ues of investor protection indicators developed by La Porta et al (1997), andPistor (2000) for the Hungarian case as they stand now.  Section 3.2 deter-mines the enforcement indicators of La Porta- Lopez-de-Silanes-Shleifer(2003), which has not been done for Hungary to the best of our knowledge,besides giving some material to understand the meaning of law enforcementin the Hungarian context. Section 4 offers two case studies enabling us to ap-preciate the significance of legal dynamics. Section 5 concludes.
2 A
BOUT HUNGARIAN COMMERCIAL LAW
Hungarian civil law is German in legal origin. By the analysis of La Porta et
al (1997), this fact would suggest that the chances are not very good for in-vestors’ rights being  particularly strongly protected by the laws. The sampleused by La Porta et al (1997) and La Porta et al (1998) contained six Germanlegal origin countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, South Korea,Taiwan). (The other three groups included common law-origin, French-origin,and Scandinavian-origin countries.) The general result was that outside in-vestors’ rights are best protected in common law countries, though German-origin countries perform relatively well in protecting creditors’ rights. Amongtransition economies Pistor  (2000) identifies many other German-origincountries, such as Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.
German law is typical “lawyers’ law”, using a very specific technical lan-
guage and definitions, striving for absolute preciseness. It makes also a veryextensive use of codes. This is in contrast with the judge-made character ofCommon Law, and the more laymen-oriented French tradition. A corollary of
7
the German-style approach is that codes are classified in a way that seems
strange to non-lawyers, with apparently very different issues being broughttogether by general concepts. (For instance, selling and doing damage cancome together in the same rule, since both acts create “in personam ” rights.).
In Hungary under the socialist era, business law did not have a particularly
prominent role in regard to the management of firms. (See Kereszty (1999).)
The Hungarian reform process in the late 1980s put great stress on modern-izing company law, as a necessary means to transform the enterprise sector,wishing to lay the foundations of a primarily private property based marketeconomy. However, the 1988 Company Law was found deficient in many re-spects, giving rise to a new wave of law-making that resulted in a new com-pany law promulgated in 1998. It is interesting to quote from the preamble ofthis latter statute:
“In 1988 the primary aim of legislation, understandably in view of the state
dominance under socialism, was to pave the way for entrepreneurship and thefounding of private companies by  residents and non-residents alike. Neces-sarily, this was only made possible by neglecting the protection of creditors,and consequently and sadly, this facilitated the abuse of law.” (Translation of
the authors.)
Whether the “neglect of creditor protection” was indeed a necessity, is a
problem we will not address below. Still one related point should be notedhere. The opinion inherent in this quotation implies that entrepreneurship ishindered by strong protection of investors. We will return to this view in theconcluding section.
A closer look at the new legislation gives the impression that legislators in
1998 did not quite, or not solely, care for the amelioration of creditors’ andequity holders’ position. Rather they were anxious about the destiny of thoseclaimants who acquired liabilities in enterprises, as it were, unintentionally.Examples include the government (tax liabilities, or social security contribu-tion liabilities), suppliers (if we think that some trade credit is normally aris-ing in business, and is not fully intentional), or society at large (by havingshares in firms via the State Property Agency). Indeed, the new legislationseemed to be concerned with defining as criminal offence many acts that hadaccompanied the privatization of many formerly state owned business entitiesvia their decapitalization.
8
A Bankruptcy Law was promulgated in 1992, whose explicit aim was to
quicken the enterprise restructuring process. It forced into bankruptcy thou-sands of enterprises, but the law preferred reorganization, and left managerswith significant room of manoeuvre, thereby tending to be less protective to-wards creditors.
3 L
AWS ON THE BOOKS AND ENFORCEMENT IN HUNGARY
3.1 Laws on the books
La Porta et al. ((1997) (1998)) advance the idea that the origin of legal sys-
tems has a very strong impact on the way outside investors’ rights are pro-tected. These papers attempt to prove that the efficiency of financial systemsis, to a large extent, determined by the strength of legal protection. Even ifone believes that enforcement is probably more important, or stresses the im-portance of cultural (religious) origins, or even if agrees with Rajan-Zingales(2001) that the political structure has in fact the most crucial impact on theevolution of the financial sector, one must admit that the law probably plays asignificant role. Pistor (2000), extending this research into transition coun-tries, defined new indicators, to cover a wider range of laws intended to pro-tect outside investors.
First we replicated the indicators reflecting shareholder rights. This first
group of legal indicators measures how well any given system of laws pro-tects minority shareholders’ rights. An indicator of 1 means strong protection,whereas 0 a lack of protection. Legal protection of outside equity holdersdoes not seem to be strong in Hungary, and international comparisons showthat it is weak even in a transition country context, see Pistor–Raiser–Gelfer(2000). However, this is what one would expect from a German-law origincountry. The next set of criteria measures creditors’ rights. La Porta et al(1997) emphasizes that analyzing creditor rights is more complex than ana-lyzing the rights of outside equity holders, since preference of one type ofcreditors might mean putting at a disadvantage some other type. The criteriafocus on senior secured creditors. It seems that creditors protection is strongerthan equity owner protection in Hungary, but it is of medium-plus strengtheven in a transition country comparison, and of lower than medium strength
9
in a full international comparison, see Pistor-Raiser-Gelfer (2000). (The num-
bering and definitions follow Pistor-Raiser-Gelfer (2000).)
3.1.1 Investor protection indicators: Shareholder rights
1. One-share one-vote principle 0
If this were the case, then there would be no discrepancy between ownership
share and voting rights. In fact, it is possible that a company charter sets amaximum degree to voting rights. One-share one-vote  is rather rare in gen-
eral, irrespective of legal origin, only 22 % of countries of the La Porta et al.(1997) sample exhibited this feature.
2. Proxy by mail 0
This means that voting can occur via mail, which is not allowed in Hungary.
This is again rare in general (18 % of all cases), except in countries with acommon-law origin, where it is pretty common.
3.a Shares cannot be blocked  1
This means that those who have an ownership title at the time of an assembly
can vote. “Shares cannot be blocked” in countries with Scandinavian andcommon law origins, and in the majority of French-origin countries. In Ger-man-origin countries, however, it is only Japan where this restriction cannotbe applied.
3.b No registration cut-off date before the meeting 1
This has changed recently from a registration cut-off date of 60 days before
the meeting.
4.a Cumulative voting or proportional representation  0
These are both voting mechanisms to ensure that minority shareholders get
some representation on the board. These institutions are unknown for Hun-garian corporate law. Indeed, these rules are allowed only in 27 % of allcountries analyzed by La Porta et al. (1997), among them only a single Euro-pean country, Spain, has this feature.
4.b Other rules to ensure proportional board representation 0
5.a Judicial recourse against decisions by executives, supervisory board 0.55.b Judicial recourse against taken by the shareholder meeting 1
10
La Porta et al. (1998) calls these last two  oppressed minorities mechanisms
that serve to give an escape route to minority shareholders, when they feel
that either the management or the assembly has made a decision that is fun-damentally against their interests. (Including mergers or even asset sales.)These mechanisms are frequently found in common-law origin countries, aswell as in a number of French law origin countries.  However, in this lattercase, all of these are non-European, with the exception of Spain.  German laworigin countries in Asia have these mechanisms, while German law origincountries in Europe do not. In the case of the former group, American influ-ence was important after WWII. No Scandinavian law origin country knowsof this institution.
6. Pre-emptive right to new issues for current shareholders 1
This gives precedence to old shareholders in the event of new public offer-
ings, and exists in Hungary. This right is most common in Scandinavian laworigin countries, and not infrequently found in French law origin countries.
7. Shareholders representing less than 10 % of total shares may demand the
convocation of and extraordinary shareholder meeting 1
8. Mandatory dividends 0
This exists in some French-origin countries.
9. Executives are appointed and dismissed by the supervisory board, rather
than by the shareholder meeting 0
Both rights belong to the shareholder meeting in Hungary.
10. Management and supervisory board members can be dismissed without
cause 1
11. A 50 % minimum quorum requirement for a shareholder meeting to take
binding decisions 1.
At the first call at least half of voters must be present, but the company charter
can give a higher threshold. At the second call there is no minimum require-ment.
12 The right of minority shareholders to call an audit commission 1
If at least 10 % of voting shareholders request it, the court will order an audit
despite a contrary decision by the shareholder meeting.
11
13. Supermajority requirement (at least ¾) for adopting decisions that affect
the existence of the corporation in its current form 0.75
There is a 75 % majority rule in respect of the following decisions:  modify-
ing the charter, liquidation, change of legal form, but major assets can be soldwithout the supermajority requirement.
14.Supervisory board members are elected only by shareholders 0
15 Right to transfer shares may not be limited 1
16 No formal requirement exists for the transfer of shares 1
17 Minority shareholders have a put option 0
18 Mandatory takeover bid threshold exists  0,75
The threshold is 30 %.
19 Conflict of interest rules 0
Only the prospectus contains such provisions.
20 Shareholder register must be conducted by an independent firm 0
21 Insider trading is prohibited by law 1
22 Threshold for mandatory disclosure in case of acquisition of large block of
shares 1
The threshold is 10 %.
23 A state agency conducts capital market supervision 1
24 Capital market supervision is independent 0
It is subordinated to the Ministry of Finance.
3.1.2 Investor protection indicators: creditors’ rights
1. Restrictions for going into reorganization 0
This means that reorganization procedures can be initiated only with the con-
sent of creditors. This restriction does not exist in Hungarian law. This re-striction is quite common in common-law and Scandinavian-law origin coun-tries, and exists in Germany and Austria as well.
12
2. No automatic stay on secured assets 0
This means that during reorganization secured creditors may not repossess
collateral. The lack of this restriction on creditors’ rights is frequent in com-mon law and German-law origin countries. While Switzerland has this re-striction, Austria or Germany do not.
3. Secured creditors first  1
This means that in the event of liquidation creditors with secured debts enjoy
precedence. Secured creditors are given priority in common-law, German-laworigin and Scandinavian-law origin countries.
4. Management does not stay during reorganization  1
This means that a defaulted company’s managers cannot participate in the re-
organization process. In most common law countries the value is 1, whereasin all Scandinavian and European German-origin countries it is 0. The aver-age for French-origin countries is roughly 0.26.
5. Legal reserve 1
Qualified majority of shareholders is needed for voluntary dissolution.
6. Automatic trigger to file bankruptcy 0
There is no automatic trigger to initiate bankruptcy.
7. Creditor consent is necessary  for reorganization or liquidation 0
8. Establishing a security interest in movable assets does not require transfer
of assets 1
9. Law requires establishment of register for security interests in movables 1
10. An enforceable security interest in land may be established 1
Land can be used as collateral, but the land market is so thin that it is infre-
quently used.
11. Legal provisions that allow creditors to pierce the corporate veil 1
12. Management can be held liable for violating provisions of insolvency law 1
13. Transactions preceding the opening of bankruptcy procedure may be de-
clared null and void 1
This provision applies even more than 1 year prior the bankruptcy procedure.

3.2 Enforcement
La Porta–Lopez-de-Silanes–Shleifer (2003) defines two sets of indices for the
evaluation of enforcement. To the first set belong characteristics bearing ondisclosure requirements and liabilities (private enforcement). The secondcontains indicators concerning the character of the Supervisor, its investiga-tory powers, non-criminal and criminal sanctions (public enforcement). InAppendix 3 we give short definitions and values for Hungary. (For precisedefinitions of scores see La Porta–Lopez-de-Silanes–Shleifer (2003).)  Avalue of “1” generically means strong enforcement of investor protection,whereas a “0” the lack of it. The private enforcement index combines the firstthree indices, and the public enforcement index the last two. The scores are0.36 and 0.31. Comparisons with other countries (see Table 1) indicate weak
private enforcement, and weaker than average public enforcement. It is inter-esting to note that in German legal origin countries public enforcement is ap-parently even weaker than in Hungary. However, one may ask whether theseenforcement indicators are not to be amendable with other aspects of the en-forcement issue. Or one may wonder whether political dependence of the su-pervisor, which seems to be the case in Hungary, would not nullify or weakenthe effects of other aspects of public enforcement.

3.2.1 Private enforcement
Disclosure requirements
Prospectus: 1
Listed securities cannot be sold without providing a prospectus.
Compensation: 0
The compensation of directors and key officers are not required to be reported
in the prospectus.
Shareholders: 0.5
The name and ownership stake of “substantial” shareholders must be dis-
closed, but it is only direct shareholding with which the law is concerned.
Inside ownership: 1
The ownership shares of directors and key officers must be disclosed indi-
vidually.
Irregular contracts: 0
No requirement exists to disclose material contracts made by the issuer out-
side its course of ordinary business.
Transactions: 0.5
Some, but not all transactions between the issuer and “’related parties” (di-
rectors, key officers, shareholders) must be included in the prospectus. (Towit: those that materially influence the working of the corporation.)
The disclosure index is the arithmetic average of the above six values, which
in this case equals 0.5. (See in Table 1 the corresponding values for the aver-age of countries participating in the La Porta- Lopez-de-Silanes-Shleifer(2003) study, and for the average of German legal origin countries in theaforementioned study.)
Liability regime (burden of proof)
Burden director: 0
Investors cannot sue directors directly in case of misinformation given in the
prospectus. (Though they can sue the issuer that can sue directors. So maybe1/3 would be a more  appropriate score.)
15
Burden distributor: 2/3
Misleading statements in the prospectus are not sufficient for the liability of
the distributor, it must be proven also that there was a causal relationshipbetween misinformation and loss.
Burden accountant: 0
Restitution from the accountant (i.e auditor) is not available.
The burden of proof index has an average of 0,22.
3.2.2 Public enforcement
Characteristics of security market supervisor
Appointment: 0
Appointment is unilaterally made by the Executive.
Tenure: 0
The appointing authority can dismiss.
Focus:0
There is no separate supervisor for stock exchanges and banks.
Rules: 0
The supervisor cannot issue regulations concerning primary offerings.
Accordingly the average is 0, which unfavorably compares to an average of
0.5 in the sample of La Porta–Lopez-de-Silanes–Shleifer (2003). Still a 0 av-erage exists in other countries, such as Belgium, Japan and Norway.
Investigative powers of the supervisor
Document: 1
The supervisor can issue an order for everyone to turn over documents for the
sake of investigation.
Witness. 0
The supervisor cannot subpoena.
The average is 0.5, which is lower than the La Porta–Lopez-de-Silanes–
Shleifer (2003) average of 0.6, but is above the very low (0.17) average ofGerman legal origin countries.
16
Orders
Order issuer: 0.5.
Limited range of actions can be required by the supervisor from the issuer.
Order distributor 0.5
Again limited is the range of actions the supervisor can order to rectify prob-
lems with a prospectus.
Orders accountant: 0
The supervisor cannot require any action form the auditor.
The average orders index is 0.33, which is jut a little below the La Porta–Lo-
pez-de-Silanes–Shleifer (2003) average of 0.38, and significantly above theGerman legal origin country average of 0.04.
Criminal sanctions
Criminal director/officer: 0,5.
Criminal distributor: 0.5Criminal accountant: 0.5
Only awareness of misinformation in the prospectus leads to criminal liability
in all three cases.
The average is 0.5, which corresponds to the La Porta- Lopez-de-Silanes-
Shleifer (2003) average, and is above the German legal origin country averageof 0.42.
3.2.3 Enforcement in practice
So far we have dealt with enforcement form the point of view of laws, not of
actual practice. Actual practice can be assessed for instance by questionnaires.Systematic studies of law enforcement in transition countries have been car-ried out under the aegis of the EBRD. The annual survey of the EBRD makescomposite assessments in terms of legal indicators in transition economies.There exist two types of indicators, one for judging commercial law and theother for financial regulation.
As for commercial law, Hungary has been in the lead among transition coun-
tries, but together with 9 other countries. The explanations given in theEBRD’s Transition Report 2000 indicate that the main problems are with the
17
pledge law (the lack of a centralized registry), and the efficiency of the courts.
As for financial regulation, Hungary shares first place with Poland and Slove-nia. Basically the EBRD Reports state that the regulatory framework is simi-lar to those customary in developed countries, but „it may benefit from moresystematic and rigorous enforcement”, i.e. one may get away with breachingthe law more easily.
To understand what the problems with the efficiency of the courts mean we
can quote Kereszty (1999 )  at some length.
“In 1998 almost 8000 liquidation procedures were started, but in most cases
liquidators found empty (phantom) companies. In about 80 % of liquidatedcompanies there were no assets at all, and in numerous cases it was impossi-ble to find any documentation, let alone the executive officer. On the otherhand, the relative and absolute number of reorganization procedures has di-minished since 1992.”

Source:  Ministry of Justice, Hungary. Quoted by Kereszty (1999).
Kereszty (1999) then proceeds with the woes of creditors, For instance, liqui-
dators claim that the reduction in the number of reorganization procedureshave certain mutually reinforcing reasons. It is estimated that due to thelengthiness of bankruptcy procedures, in 30 % of commercial cases courtscannot reach a decision within one year, while creditors want to get theirmoney as soon as possible, and do not want to reorganize the firms in distress.At the same time, banks may try to have a side deal with debtor firms, ratherthan initiating a bankruptcy procedure, where they have to share the liquida-tion value with other creditors. This explains why creditors sometimes chooseto liquidate solvent companies with only transitory liquidity problems. (See
Table 2  for more details.)
                    
1 1992 was the year when the new bankruptcy law was introduced.
18
According to Kereszty (1999) if a firm goes into liquidation in Hungary the
majority of creditors make losses, sometimes recovering nothing at all. This isobviously a very serious problem in particular for small entrepreneurs, whoprovide trade credit. In the latter half of the 1990s tax, social security and tar-iff liabilities of companies in bankruptcy amounted to 400 billion forints, andthe recovery ratio was about 5 %. Liquidation costs were estimated amountingto 50-100 thousand forints per case, which is a large loss regarding that in 8out of 10 cases the liquidated firm had zero liquidation value.
The full story can be complemented with noticing that, after 1989, about
400,000 companies have been registered, of which 70,000 ceased to exist by1998. It was widely believed that 1/3 of all companies did not submit any bal-ance sheet report as required by the law. A frequent complaint was that ex-ecutive officers did not pass the company books to the liquidator, or sign an
affidavit.  This happened despite the fact that they could be fined, or even
prosecuted.

EGAL DYNAMICS
4.1  Case study 1: Acquisitions
The legal regulation of acquisitions and mergers is important both for pro-
tecting minority shareholders, and also for ensuring that managers can becontrolled by the threat of takeovers.  In Hungary a 1996 statute on Stock Ex-change stipulated that any purchase of more than 33 % of shares in a publicshareholding company necessitates a public offer.
2 This is clearly a “bright
line rule”, whose extensive use is characteristic of civil law systems. The bigproblem with bright line rules is that they can be frequently circumvented. Wecan illustrate this thesis by the following case study.
Borsodchem is a public company belonging to the chemical industry. Its main
input supplier is TVK, another public company, which purchases its naturalgas and oil requirements from  MOL (the Hungarian Oil Company), one ofthe biggest enterprises in Central Europe, and the largest firm quoted at theBudapest Stock Exchange. The three companies were tied together with
                    
2 It is interesting to note that a similar loophole was created by a similar bright line rule in
he US, a century ago.
19
cross-ownership, and also by the fact that the government had ownership
shares in each of them. They had also cooperated closely over the years.
In the Summer of 2000, Milford Holdings, an Irish off-shore company, ac-
quired some 24.75% of Borsodchem’s shares. Beside Milford, two Austriancompanies and a Russian bank also bought shares in Borsodchem, amountingto a combined share of over 50 %. On the announcement of these events stockprices fell by some 20 %. The reason for this was that there was a generalsuspicion that Gazprom, the Russian oil giant was behind these actions.
The Hungarian supervision agency started an investigation into the ownership
structure of Borsodchem in October 2000, and suspended the voting rights ofMilford. As a response Milford sold its shares to a Hungarian bank (CIB), butsimultaneously acquired a buy option for Sibur, a Russian firm. (Sibur wasknown to be an affiliate of Gazprom.) It turned out that the contract also en-sured that CIB would vote according to the interests of Sibur in the January2001 shareholders’ meeting of Borsodchem. In fact, in that meeting CIBchanged the executive and supervisory boards completely, in cooperationwith the two Austrian companies. Finally, in July 2001 one of the Austrianfirms made a public offer, at a price which was about half of the price pre-vailing before these events started to unfold.
These events caused turmoil, resulting in radical changes in legislation. The
new legal formula does not contain bright line rules, interpreting the term“acquiring influence” very widely, and subsuming even the “coordinated actsof independent actors” within this category. Clearly, this formulation puts agreater burden on judges, whose interpretation of the law will become moreimportant. The question is, whether Hungarian judges are prepared and/or aregiven the right incentives to assume law-making functions. This problem un-derlines the role of both enforcement and the efficiency of the judicial system,and its independence of political influence. However, most observers believedthat political interference was a key element in the Borsodchem story.
4.2 Case study 2: Risk capital regulation
Venture capital is presumably aimed at supplying equity finance to high-risk
startup companies, that may be innovative, too. Initially, venture capital wasan American phenomenon. Despite some active government participation,legislation has not played any role in promoting this type of financing in theUS. In the common law tradition, existing rules were applied or adapted.
20
In contrast, the mostly civil law based European approach has been different.
Besides providing direct support to venture capitalists, European legislatorsthought wiser to introduce new specific laws. This was the route followed byHungary, as could be expected on account of its legal traditions.
The view behind supporting risk capital is that there exists a market failure
here, and with appropriate incentives the state can enhance technological de-velopment. If the incentives include tax incentives, this provides a good rea-son for legal intervention, but it is, of course, not necessary that tax incentivesbe part of government support.
The 1998 “Act on Venture Capital Investments, Venture Capital Associations,
and Venture Capital Funds” had basically three goals:
1. supporting the financing of high risk-high return activities2. preventing tax evasion3. protecting investors.
As noted above, item 1 is the specific goal, and item 2 is a corollary of it. Item
3 is a generic principle, as the protection of investors seems to be in the fore-front of more recent Hungarian economic legislation.
To achieve the main goal (promoting investment in risky ventures) tax holi-
days (rebates) are stipulated by the law. In economic terms this is equivalentto raising the expected return on the investment, without affecting the conse-quences of bad (loss-making) outcomes. To reduce the risk incurred by in-vestors, another part of the law stipulates that the government provide guar-antees for risk capital funds.  It is a key question whether these things reallyappropriately belong to the law. Nevertheless, the special provisions whichdistinguish a risk capital fund from a normal investment fund cannot be justi-fied unless the above incentives are in place.
The most important restrictions on risk capital funds refer to their legal form,
their minimum capital requirement, their admissible investment portfolio, andtheir accounting rules. With respect to the first, any risk capital fund must bea shareholding company. This restriction is not quite understandable, as riskcapital usually needs personal involvement by experts, who are able to adviseand monitor the firms they deal with.
As for the second, the minimum capital requirement for a risk capital fund is
500 million forints, ten times the normal sum for shareholding companies.Again, this requirement may have two implications: either increasing the size
21
or the number of projects. Increasing the size of projects may result in more
risk-taking, whereas a larger number of projects may burden the advisory-supervisory capacity of the risk fund. There is little reason to increase risk-taking, while the resources for advising-supervising are presumably scarce.
The next restriction ensures that risk funds are involved in risky activities, in
the form of providing equity, rather than investing safe. This restriction isclearly a corollary of the tax exemptions, since risky investments are the pri-mary reason why a risk capital fund should be given tax incentives.
Finally, there is a set of detailed accounting rules, mostly aimed at preventing
companies from finding loopholes, and from raising executive compensationby tax avoidance. This is quite understandable again as a corollary of the na-ture of incentives the law wishes to give.
One may ask where investors’ protection is to be found in this law. Investor
protection is provided by government guarantees (hardly a subject for a legalrule), and maybe, in the minimum capital requirement. Otherwise, protectinginvestors falls under the authority of the company law, with respect to share-holding companies. As we have seen this is not the strongest protection in aninternational comparison.
We can draw a few lessons from risk capital fund legislation. First, the law
regulating risk capital was not introduced as a response to practical problems.Its content betrays no serious economic analysis. Rather, this is a law whichwas introduced because other countries had had their own statutes. The lawstrives for internal consistency, at the cost of dealing with many problems thatproperly should not be dealt with by legislators. In short, this is indeed a“lawyers’ law”, caring little for economic agents or economists, and wishingto provide judges with “bright line rules” rather than invite them to interpretthe law. As shown in the former example this is not a route that is easily ne-gotiable. On the other hand we cannot see what sort of events could occur topush legislators into modifying this law. There is little chance that politicalmotives would interfere.
The main negative consequences of this approach are twofold.  First, the law
may hinder the creation of small risk capital undertakings with true valueadded, i.e. where experts provide advisory and supervisory services to startupentrepreneurs. Second, it is hard to believe that the bright line rules exten-sively used in the formulation of the law can prevent circumvention, and, pos-sibly, one of the “uses” of this law will be reducing tax liabilities legally,
22
without engaging in those risky investment activities the law was made to
support. However, these two problems are unlikely to generate public dissent,or government dissatisfaction. As the potential for true venture capital under-takings is probably not very large in Hungary, the first adverse effect will berarely noticed. On the other hand, the regulation is good enough to preventthe most blatant abuse of tax incentives.

ONCLUSIONS
This study has indicated the legal protection of outside investors in Hungary
is probably relatively weak. So now we can ask: what are the mechanisms thatguarantee the return on investment in Hungary, and what sort of investors arethere? Shleifer–Vishny (1997) suggests that concentrated ownership is themost widespread and most plausible solution in such a situation. Indeedconcentrated ownership and self-finance characterizes the largest part of theHungarian economy, but this governance style comes in two varieties:multinationals and domestic private owners.
Multinational ownership is effectively transferring the problem outside the
borders. Whether this is an efficient solution would need a separateinternational comparative work. Domestic concentrated private ownership isanother solution with some commendable features, but with a vengeance. Thisappears to be an escape from agency problems and the commitment problembehind the soft budget constraint phenomenon, too. However, the budgetconstraint of these firms may be too strong, linking too closely togetherinvestment and current profitability. Concentrated ownership suffers fromother inefficiencies as well. For instance, it reduces the incentives of non-owner stakeholders to make firm-specific investments, and probably put a li-mit to the growth of enterprises.
There exists, however, a third government style, substantial state involvement
in a combination of ways. In fact, this might have positive effects bylessening the force of the inefficiencies arising from concentrated ownership.However, one can be always suspicious, whether state ownership will notresult in politically motivated, economically inefficient decisions frequently.Again this is a topic for further international comparative research.
Our analysis of the Hungarian company law confirms that the protection of
outside equity investors is relatively poor according to laws in the books,
23
which is not surprising in view of  the German legal origin of the country.  As
Pistor et al (2000) strongly emphasized, transition experience has shown thatenforcement of laws are more important for investor protection than laws onthe books. Having said that, we do not believe that legislation is totally unim-portant, indeed its importance will increase in tandem with the improvementin enforcement. Current lawmaking should have a more active role in thestrengthening of enforcement. Two tendencies can be observed: one leadingto more reliance on the interpretation of law by judges, responding to actualchallenges, and the second, following the German-tradition, resulting in ahigher number of bright line rules, and more complicated legal regulation. Tomake the former workable requires political and financial independence as anecessary, though not sufficient, condition. All in all, a larger emphasisshould be put on enforcement than on emulating “Western” laws (the latter issimpler). Another important point is that a simple tax code may be a prerequi-site to a good legal framework, since the chief concern of lawmakers involvesthe undoing of loopholes provided by a complicated tax system, which is es-pecially unsuitable for very small businesses.
Besides influencing enforcement, legislation can shape the behavior of finan-
cial market participants, and the extent of financial markets in several ways.New legislation sometimes strives for greater prudence by providing brightline rules, rather than letting the public learn.  Investor protection supports thesupply of outside funds, but there is a demand side to external finance, andstricter prudential regulation can lead to less demand for external finance. Onthe other hand, investment restrictions on certain groups of investors canweaken the supply side, too.
It is interesting to note how economic legislation developed in Hungary. We
divide the reasons why new laws were promulgated into roughly three catego-ries: 1. Practical  reasons. These changed with transition proceeding, here be-sides a longer term view, legislators were usually worried about short termproblems. 2. External demand. This is basically the demand set by interna-tional organizations Hungary has wished to join. 3. Internal reasons. Appar-ently these follow from the internal logic of the legal system.   For interna-tional comparative studies of the legal infrastructure it would be useful tolearn about the dynamics of legal change, what sort of motives make countriesadopt new laws. In this way one may find out something about the ability oflegal systems to adapt successfully or less successfully to unforeseen chal-lenges.
24
Hay–Shleifer–Vishny (1996) provide an example of how legal systems must
be reformed with a definite goal, which is in their case the effective imple-mentation of privatization. We can only make some modest proposals here.Path dependence and other external factors may limit the scope of law inshaping corporate governance. It may be worthwhile to find out what otherinvestor protection mechanisms exist in Hungary, and whether they are effi-cient arrangements or not.  From a policy point of view this sort of investiga-tion would help focus institutional changes on improving the availablemechanisms. For example, a discovery  that there is little chance that the mar-ket for corporate control will play a major  direct role in Hungarian corporategovernance would have certain implications about the utility of efforts tobroaden and deepen the local stock exchange. Should the conclusion be that itis more plausible that banks could play a more significant role in the financ-ing of medium sized companies with concentrated ownership, then legislationand other governmental actions should shift focus onto promoting the bank-led governance style. Indeed, our paper suggests that the above two condi-tionals are true.

2/Introduction & Legal S ystem
Legal & court system
Hungary is an independent, democratic, constitutional state. Under its Fundamental Law,
Hungary is a parliamentary republic, meaning that its executive, legislative and judicature
branches are separate.
The main and highest law of Hungary is the Fundamental Law. The Fundamental Law of
Hungary regulates two classic constitutional areas: state administration (national and local
government and organisations for the protection of rights) and citizens' basic rights.
Hungary has a civil law system. In addition to the Fundamental Law, there are acts of Par-
liament, governmental and ministerial decrees (which are valid only if published in the Official
Gazette), and decrees of local governments (which also need to be published). Hungary be-
came a Member State of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches. The highest court
in the Hungarian court system is the Curia. First-instance jurisdiction in most matters rests
with local courts, effecting the principle that the majority of cases should be settled at a local
level within the easiest reach of the parties. Operating parallel to the local courts are the pub-
lic administration and labour courts, specialising in the revision of decisions of public authori-
ties and those arising in labour disputes. Appeals against the decisions of local courts may be
submitted to higher courts (regional courts and regional courts of appeal) acting as appellate
courts. In certain cases specified by law, however, regional courts act as the court of first in-
stance. The territorial competence of the local and regional courts is determined by (and iden-
tical to) the areas of public administration. The right of remedy is ensured in the Hungarian ju-
risdiction. The regional courts of appeal hear the appeals lodged against decisions of local and
regional courts. There are five regional courts of appeal throughout the country – in Budapest,
Szeged, Pécs, Debrecen and Győr. Taking over the task of examining appeals, the regional 
courts of appeal have significantly reduced the backlog of cases in the Curia. As a result, the
Curia can now concentrate on its main function of ensuring the uniform application of law and
examining applications for the review of final judgments. Extraordinary remedy is also en-
sured in certain cases; if there is no further right to appeal, the parties have the right to an ex-
traordinary remedy such as the review of the judgment of lower level courts by the Curia
based on violation of the law.
Governmental system
The President holds the highest office in Hungary. He is elected by Parliament every five
years. Although he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he has a largely ceremonial
role.
Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the unicameral Parliament which
consists of 199 members elected by a one-round election system, which replaces the previous
3two-round system. Since the most recent elections (April 2014), Parliament has once again
been dominated by the conservative Fidesz party, with a two-thirds majority.
As the Hungarian political system is parliamentary, the Government is held accountable
by the Parliament. Parliament monitors the Government, and if it concludes that the Govern-
ment is not discharging its responsibilities satisfactorily, it may withdraw its support for it
through a constructive vote of no confidence.
The Government is the most important organ of executive power and the chief controller
of public administration. The Government has the right through the competent branch minis-
ters to freely replace any public officer or governmental officer. This means that it implements
decisions made by the Parliament, as the legislative organ, and pursues the goals laid out in
the Government's programme (adhering to the Government's pre-formulated programmes of
the Government).
The Hungarian Government comprises the Prime Minister and government ministers. The
Prime Minister is the head of the Government. The Prime Minister is elected by the Parlia-
ment following a proposal from the President. At the same time, the Parliament votes on the
Government's programme. The Prime Minister has to determine the general direction of Gov-
ernment policy within the context of the Government's programme. The President appoints
ministers according to the Prime Minister's recommendations. In addition, the Prime Minister
chairs cabinet meetings and ensures the implementation of Government decisions.
The Prime Minister may nominate one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, chosen from
among the ministers. At present there are two Deputy Prime Ministers who carry out specific
tasks in addition to deputising for the Prime Minister in certain situations he has specified.
One of these Deputy Prime Ministers is responsible for the structure of public administration
and its efficient operation, while the other coordinates and manages national policy and
church affairs on a permanent basis.
A large part of a minister's work is taken up with guiding and supervising a given ministry
(being a Government department). It is the task of a minister to develop statutory proposals
to promote effective operation within the minister's specialist area of responsibility and to
implement the Government’s programme. They must also represent the Hungarian Govern-
ment at the European Council or other international organisations.
Public administration operates efficiently when policy and traditional public administra-
tion tasks are separate. This is reflected in the new structure of public administration where a
state secretary acts as a deputy for a minister, with full delegated ministerial powers for a giv-
en specialist department. Each minister can be responsible for several departments: for ex-
ample one minister is responsible for education, sport and healthcare.
Ministers of state are divided into three categories: state secretaries responsible for spe-
cial areas (e.g. education); state secretaries responsible for administrative tasks; and parlia-
mentary ministers of state. State secretaries responsible for special areas are political leaders,
while the posts of public administration and parliamentary state secretaries are politically
neutral, as is the post of Deputy Minister of State. A public administration state secretary is a
4specialist leader of a ministry's organisational operations, while the responsibilities of a par-
liamentary state secretary are towards Parliament.
Policy approach
Hungary is the only country in Central and Eastern Europe where all governments have
been able to fulfil their four-year mandate with no interim elections.
In 1989, Hungary started its reintegration into the world economy. The country opened
up to direct foreign investments and liberalised its trade regime. Privatisation began and was
almost finished by the second half of the 1990s. Hungary joined the OECD in 1996 and NATO
in 1999.
Over the past 25 years, conservative and social-liberal governments have alternately been
in power. At the last parliamentary elections in April 2014, the conservative FIDESZ-Hungarian
Civil Alliance ( FIDESZ-MPSZ ) won with a majority. Apart from Fidesz in 2010, no single party
has had a two-thirds mandate since Hungary's transition to democracy 25 years ago. Fidesz's
central key goals have been to reform the system of local governments, the electoral system
and media law, and it aims to ease the process for Hungarian nationals in neighbouring coun-
tries to obtain dual citizenship.
Hungary offers a number of benefits and incentives for new investors as well as for com-
panies already active in the country. Generally, investors qualify for incentives when they sur-
pass a certain investment value or number of jobs created.
The Hungarian taxation system is now close to the level of complexity found in Western
Europe. Tax laws in Hungary are enacted by Parliament and the tax authority provides inter-
pretative and administrative guidelines for these laws. Court decisions play an increasing role
in interpreting tax laws and, as a result of Hungary's accession to the EU, European Court of
Justice case law is also applicable.
Hungarian tax is paid by self-assessment. All taxpayers have to register, determine their
tax obligations, make payments in advance, file tax returns on their own behalf, make correc-
tions to the tax returns as needed, keep records and supply information as required by law.
Authorities randomly examine tax returns to keep track of the self-assessment system. Corpo-
rations are subject to continuous assessment throughout the year. The Head of the National
Tax and Customs Authority ( NAV ) determines the target audit areas for the tax authority in
the tax year concerned. The tax year is the calendar year for individuals and the calendar year
or the financial year for companies (the financial year of companies varies from the calendar
year only in limited cases). In general, tax returns must be filed annually. For VAT, payroll and
withholding taxes, however, quarterly or monthly filings may be required.
Central taxes:
 Corporate income tax
 VAT
 Personal income tax
5Local taxes:
 Building tax
 Land tax
 Communal tax
 Local business tax
Tax-related incentives:
 Development tax allowance
 R&D-related tax benefits
6/Foreign Investment Policy
Hungary is one of the most developed countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Many for-
eign investors have become active in Hungary since the beginning of the 1990s. As a result,
modern industrial facilities and moderate incomes have created an attractive economic mar-
ket with a high export potential. Here the companies with a Western European or overseas
domicile also profit from Hungary's strategic location as a "bridge to Eastern Europe".
About one third of the country's foreign investments continue to originate from large and
medium-sized companies, especially from the automobile and engineering industries in Ger-
many. The Hungarian Government is building on its traditional strengths which include the
training of specialists for technical products and IT. A wide range of concepts are being used
to encourage foreign companies within these industries to invest in Hungary.
Within the state aid legal framework of the EU, the Hungarian Government supports in-
vestment projects with a one-stop-shop service including "VIP treatment" and comprehensive
information about available subsidies for investment projects. The current structure of the
governmental bodies coping with the support of foreign investors is coordinated by the Minis-
ter of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and include various types of organisations involved in the
promotion of investment, such as investment banks, trading and investment promotion agen-
cies.
Regarding the available incentives, it should be noted that Hungary is entitled to approx-
imately€40 billion from EU funds during the period of 2014–2020, 60% of which will be spent
on developing the Hungarian economy and focusing on R&D&I projects and investments of
SMEs, according to the Government's plans. Beside EU funds, there are nationally funded sub-
sidies as well, aiming to support investment projects creating new workplaces and targeting
training projects to assure the availability of a well-educated workforce.
7/Types of Business V ehicles
Forms of business vehicle
Foreign investors prefer (in the majority of cases) to establish limited liability companies
for the purposes of starting their business activities in Hungary. The main characteristics of
the relevant limited liability corporate forms are described below.
In Hungary, limited liability companies can either be a "Kft." (company limited by quotas;
hereinafter Kft.), a public company ( Nyrt ., stock company, not described in this summary) or a
private company limited by shares ( Zrt.). For international operations, it is also possible to es-
tablish a European Company ( Societas Europaea ) with its registered office in Hungary, based
on the conditions prescribed by the rules of the relevant European Union regulation.
Relevant vehicle
The limited liability company form is preferred, as its members/shareholders (with certain
exceptions) are only liable for the company's losses to the extent of their contributions.
From the available corporate forms it is generally easier to establish a "company limited
by quotas" (see description below).
Registration formalities
After signing the necessary documentation, the company must be registered in the trade
register by the competent court of registration. This procedure is administered by a lawyer or
a notary public.
Although it is possible to sign the formation documents outside Hungary, all the docu-
ments would need to be signed in front of a notary public and, in certain cases, an apostille al-
so needs to be attached. If the documents are signed in Hungary, the involvement of a notary
public is not required and lawyers may countersign documents.
A Kft. or Zrt. may be incorporated using an ordinary procedure or a simplified procedure,
whereas a stock company (Nyrt.) can only be incorporated with admission to the Budapest
Stock Exchange via traditional public offering from a Zrt.
The simplified procedure is significantly faster and cheaper but the founders are not free
to decide on the contents of the company's articles of association. The founders are free to
draft the articles under the ordinary procedure.
Ordinary procedure Simplified procedure
Registration costs HUF 105 ,000 HUF 50 ,000
Timescale 15 business days after
filing the application1 working hour (+ 1 day
should be taken into ac-
8count)
A company is legally established only upon registration in the Hungarian trade register,
but it may conduct certain activities (as a pre-company) from the date of foundation, i.e. from
the time of countersigning of the executed version of the articles of association by the attor-
ney preparing the formation documents. However, any activities that are subject to prior au-
thorisation (e.g. the commencement of any financial services related activities) cannot be
conducted in the pre-company phase.
The Kft. has a lower capital requirement (minimum registered capital: HUF 3,000,000),
while the Zrt. may only be established with a minimum capital of HUF 5,000,000, and the Nyrt.
with HUF 20,000,000. Registered capital can be freely increased, i.e. no statutory maximum is
applicable in this respect.
Members' contributions of capital can be provided either in cash or in kind, or as a com-
bination of the two.
The quotas of a Kft. and the shares of a Zrt./Nyrt. may be freely transferred or encum-
bered unless a shareholders' agreement or the articles provide otherwise.
A Nyrt. or Zrt. can issue preference shares which may grant different preferential rights to
the shareholders. The possibility to issue preferential shares may be an advantage for foreign
investors planning to acquire shares in a Hungarian entity.
On the other hand, the issue of preferential business quotas is not possible in the case of
Kfts. It is, however, theoretically possible to attach different rights to different types of quotas
in the Kft.'s articles of association.
With regard to a Kft., if not otherwise stipulated or precluded in the articles of associa-
tion, the members and then the company (in this sequence) have a pre-emption right, i.e. of-
fers must first be made to existing quotaholders in connection to the quotas being transferred
to a third party. It is also possible to set out pre-emption rights in relation to the shares in the
case of a Zrt.

Members' (shareholders') meeting
The members'/shareholders' meeting is the highest decision-making body of a Kft. and
Zrt./Nyrt. and consists of the company's members/shareholders. Special rules apply with re-
gard to "single-member/shareholder" companies (see below).
A simple majority vote of the members'/shareholders' meeting is sufficient in most cases.
For some matters, however, a 75% majority is required by law (e.g. for changing the articles of
association). The articles of association may specify certain matters where the mem-
bers/shareholders may decide without holding a members’/shareholders' meeting, as well as
the method of decision. The articles may also allow the holding of members'/shareholders'
meetings by means of electronic communications.
The Kft. and Zrt. may also operate as a single-member/shareholder company. In this case,
the single member/shareholder exercises the decision-making rights of the mem-
10bers'/shareholders' by passing written resolutions. In addition, the single mem-
ber/shareholder may directly instruct the management.
There are no restrictions with respect to foreign members/shareholders.
Management
The management of a Kft. is carried out by one or more managing directors (i.e. the single
managing directors act on their own).
In the case of an Nyrt., a board of directors consisting of three or more members must be
set up. A Zrt. must be operated by a single director or by a board of directors (three or more
members).
The appointed directors may be authorised to sign on behalf of the company solely or
jointly with other directors.
Directors carry out their duties independently, meaning that their activities are governed
only by law, the articles of association and the previous members'/shareholders' resolutions.
This also means that directors may not be instructed concerning their management activities
(with the exception of single-member/shareholder companies).
The articles may, however, provide that certain decisions may only be made subject to
the prior consent of the members'/shareholders' meeting (or the supervisory board). It should
be noted that these restrictions on representation incorporated in the articles of association
only bind the directors and the members/shareholders, i.e. the restrictions are not effective
towards third parties (e.g. prior authorisation of the members' meeting may be required to
conclude agreements above a certain contractual value limit).
Officers of companies may hold any nationality.
Directors' liability
Directors must carry out their activities with due care and in the interests of the compa-
ny. Directors are jointly and severally liable to the members/shareholders for their acts and
omissions. In certain cases, directors may also have liability towards the creditors of the com-
pany if, in the event of a liquidation procedure, the company does not have sufficient assets
to satisfy its creditors.
The new Civil Code kept the previously adopted regulations introducing new statutory
provisions excluding a person who has been an executive or member of an insolvent or phan-
tom company from being an executive in a new business entity.
Parent company liability
A parent company's liability is generally limited to its capital contribution. However, there
are certain important exceptions such as:
 if a company which is controlled by a dominant member (holding at least 75% of the vot-
ing rights in the company) is going into liquidation, the dominant member has to bear un-
11limited liability for all liabilities of the company that are not covered by its assets (provid-
ed that the court has declared the unlimited and full liability of the dominant member re-
sponsible due to its history of making unfavourable business decisions in the debtor com-
pany) and
 if the company is liquidated, the members/shareholders who have abused their limited li-
ability or the company's legal personality to the detriment of creditors must bear unlim-
ited, joint and several liability for the unsatisfied obligations of the liquidated company
(e.g. where risky, speculative business were conducted through the limited liability com-
pany, the members may not rely on their limited liability in all situations).
Effective as of 1 March 2012, regulations introduced new statutory provisions excluding
anybody who has been an executive or member of an insolvent or phantom company from
acquiring a majority share (50% + 1) in a new company.
Reporting obligation
Companies must file their annual balance sheets with the competent authorities by
31 May of each year. This balance sheet is publicly available.
Companies must fulfil certain disclosure and reporting requirements of the court of regis-
tration following any changes in the corporate data included in the trade register (e.g. any
amendments to the articles of association, directors, members of the supervisory board, etc.).
Details for opening a branch office or representative office
A branch office is a business unit (without legal personality) through which the following
entities may operate in Hungary: foreign legal persons (i.e. companies), foreign organisations
without legal personality and other foreign-registered businesses.
A branch office comes into existence when the relevant court of registration registers the
branch office in the trade register. Prior to its registration in the trade register, the branch of-
fice may not engage in any activities which require official authorisation and/or the conduct of
which requires a licence (including activities relating to the purchase and lease of business
premises).
The branch office may be represented by persons who (i) are employed by or are as-
signed to the branch office or (ii) have resident status in Hungary and have concluded a con-
tract for services (i.e. a civil law contract) with the branch office.
The court of registration must process the branch office registration application within 15
working days.
A Hungarian commercial representative office ( CRO ) is a business unit of a foreign enter-
prise (founder) without its own legal personality, like a branch.
Business activities may not be conducted through a CRO; therefore the scope of its activi-
ties is significantly limited. A CRO may only act as an intermediary in the negotiation of con-
tracts, participate in the preparation of contracts and carry out informational, marketing and
12promotional activities on behalf of its founder and no other activities (i.e. in general, a branch
office can be seen as an independent economic unit, whilst a CRO cannot).
A CRO comes into existence when the relevant court of registration registers the CRO in
the trade register. The CRO may only commence its operations and engage in legally permit-
ted activities following its registration in the trade register.
The CRO may be represented by persons who (i) are employed by or are assigned to the
CRO or (ii) have resident status in Hungary and have concluded a contract for services (i.e. a
civil law contract) with the CRO. The persons employed by the CRO are deemed to be in a le-
gal relationship with the CRO's founder.
The court of registration must process the CRO registration application within 15 working
days.
Information for listing on local stock exchange
The regulation and operation of the capital market in Hungary is supervised by the Hun-
garian National Bank ( HNB ) (Magyar Nemzeti Bank ). The stock market operator authorised by
the HNB is the Budapest Stock Exchange ( Budapesti Értéktőzsde).
Listing equity on the Budapest Stock Exchange requires several steps. Its complexity and
timeline also depends on the "type" of listing the company requires:
 "Simple" listing on the Budapest Stock Exchange is where there is no capital increase (i.e.
issue of new shares) and no public offering of existing shares
 "Traditional public offering" is admission to the Budapest Stock Exchange together with
the offer of shares to the public, i.e. either the issue of new shares or sale by owners or a
combination of the two.
As a general rule, the admission of securities to trading on a regulated market must be
made following the preparation of a prospectus. The prospectus must contain all relevant in-
formation on the economic, market, financial and legal position of the company, giving inves-
tors the widest possible range of information. A prospectus prepared for a listing on the Bu-
dapest Stock Exchange must be submitted to the Hungarian National Bank for prior approval.
As a consequence of Hungary's EU membership and on the basis of a "single passport", the
Budapest Stock Exchange also accepts prospectuses approved by a supervisory authority of
any other EU Member State.
An application for listing must be submitted to the Budapest Stock Exchange, which must
review the application and make a decision within 30 calendar days of receipt. Various docu-
ments must be published at least two trading days before the listing on the official site for
publications of the Budapest Stock Exchange, such as the prospectus, constitutional docu-
ments, the ownership structure and the details of the registrar of shares, etc.
Listing of equity securities will fall under one of three categories, "A", "B" or "T". A cate-
gory "B" listing requires the basic legal requirements to be fulfilled. However, a category "A"
listing has additional requirements, and while the admission is stricter, category "A" equities
13generally have a better reputation in the market. Category "T" is for technical listings only, the
simplest procedure for a company to appear in the regulated market. For companies newly
entering category "T", it will be easier to move to category "A" or "B" once a public offering
has been completed.
Businesses with their securities listed on a regulated market must continue to observe
certain governance rules and market transparency requirements.
The Hungarian Civil Code does not restrict the provision of upstream guarantees (non-
beneficial decisions or decisions which provide more risks to the company and may harm the
company's interests). However, in general the acts of shareholders or executive officers which
negatively affect creditors and cause the company to become insolvent may lead to full and
joint liability for such persons. Such actions may also be considered a criminal offence.
Laws relating to the charging of assets
The charging of corporate assets is permitted in principle, subject to certain limitations.
More precisely, a company may not grant loans, give undertakings or surety or pay financial
liabilities in connection with the subscription or acquisition of shares issued by the company
prior to the subscription or acquisition of shares. This restriction only applies to joint stock
companies (joint stock limited liability companies like Zrt. or Nyrt.). These provisions do not
restrict the acquisition of shares by employees of the relevant company (i.e. the target com-
pany) or employees of companies under the majority control of the company, and transac-
tions carried out by banks and other credit institutions in their ordinary course of business do
not fall under the restrictions.
Furthermore, the quotaholders/shareholders and directors of a limited liability company
and their close relatives may not enter into transactions for the acquisition, disposal, lease or
encumbrance of corporate assets without the prior approval of shareholders. No such manda-
tory provision applies to joint stock companies, although the quotaholders/shareholders may
include such a provision in the company's deed of foundation.
14/Employment
Employee relations
Hungarian labour relations are regulated by EU and statutory legislation, case law, collec-
tive bargaining agreements and individual employment agreements. Although case law has no
legally binding force, it plays a significant role when interpreting the statutory provisions and
therefore influences employment relations in a broad sense.
Employment regulations allow efficient contracting between employers and employees,
enabling labour market flexibility on the one hand and protecting employees from discrimina-
tory or unfair treatment by employers on the other hand. The protection for employees is also
reinforced by the employee-friendly attitude of the Hungarian labour courts.
In general trade unions are not as strong as in some other countries in Western Europe,
although in some sectors such as transport, education and public health they play a significant
role in labour relations. Strikes are not as common as in some other countries in continental
Europe.
The global financial crisis has significantly affected the Hungarian economy and has re-
sulted in an increase in the overall unemployment rate (climbing to a record high of 11.8% in
the first quarter of 2010). However, in the fourth quarter of 2015 this rate went down to 6.2%
according to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. National minimum wages still lag behind
those in Western Europe: from 1 January 2016, the statutory minimum monthly wage for
workers without secondary education is HUF 111,000, and for workers with at least secondary
education HUF 129,000.
Employees in Hungary are generally highly skilled and educated, particularly in IT, engi-
neering, pharmacy, mathematics and physics. The number of employees with foreign lan-
guage skills is also increasing year-on-year.
Relevant labour and employment laws
The most important rules on labour relations are incorporated in Act I of 2012 on the La-
bour Code ( Labour Code ), which entered into force on 1 July 2012. The rules of the Labour
Code are in many ways similar to the legislation of other industrialised countries. They comply
with EU legislation and are applicable to all employment relations in Hungary.
Hungarian labour law – unless otherwise regulated by international private law, interna-
tional contracts or agreements (bilateral or multilateral) or ius cogens – applies to (i) all em-
ployment relationships where work is performed in Hungary, i.e. the Code applies to tempo-
rary projects on Hungarian territory and (ii) where the employee of a Hungarian employer
temporarily works outside Hungary.
15Contracts, agreements and implied terms governing em-
ployment relationships
Employment may only be established by a written contract, which must contain at least
the following information: the personal base salary, scope of work of the employee and the
place of work. Oral agreements concluded by the parties are also deemed to be valid unless
the employee notifies the employer of a disagreement within 30 days of their first day at
work.
As a general rule, the parties may only diverge from the provisions of the Labour Code if
the change is in the employee's favour. In some cases, however, deviating from the provisions
of the Labour Code is prohibited (e.g. termination notices must be in writing).
The employment term may be for an indefinite or a definite period; the latter may gener-
ally not exceed five years.
If an employer is bound by a local collective bargaining agreement, the relevant terms
must also be applied to the employees of the employer who are not members of the relevant
trade union.
Again, individual employment contracts may only differ from the rules of the applicable
collective agreement to the advantage of the employee. If an issue is regulated in both the
applicable collective agreement and the individual employment contract, the regulation that
is more advantageous for the employee will be deemed to apply.
The website of the Labour Ministry can be used to check whether there is an effective col-
lective bargaining agreement applicable to a certain employer.
There are also collective bargaining agreements applicable to entire business sectors and
employment relationships falling under the scope of the relevant sector collective bargaining
agreement.
Furthermore, in certain sectors, a sectoral collective agreement applies to all employers
active in that sector, whether or not they are members of a union.
Employees and management representation and corporate
transactions
Works councils may be elected at companies and their individual business units if they
have more than 50 employees. If less than 51 but more than 15 employees are employed at
the same company or one of its individual business units, a works representative may be
elected, and the representative has the same rights as the works council. Works councils and
works representatives are elected for a period of five years.
The works councils have a co-determination right concerning the use of welfare funds,
properties and institutions specified in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. In ad-
dition, works councils have a comprehensive right to express their opinion on issues such as
plans made by the employer affecting a material number of the employees (such as any reor-
16ganisation, restructuring, privatisation, modernisation of the employer, etc.), proposals on
employee training, proposals on annual holiday and new performance requirements, etc. In
such matters, however, no prior consent of the works council is required.
Employers must inform the works councils about certain other issues every half year. For
example they must inform works councils about: the basic economic situation of the employ-
er; any plans to change the business activities, any proposed changes to wages, the available
assets and the number and scope of duties of the employer, etc. Works councils are entitled
to request information from the employer relating to the social and economic interests of the
employees and their equal treatment. The employer cannot refuse to provide such infor-
mation. Any employer actions which breach the co-determination right of the works council
and the right to express their opinion are deemed void.
In the event of mass redundancies, the employer must hold consultations with the works
council before making its final decision on the redundancies. The employer must provide the
works council with the relevant information regarding the planned redundancies during the
consultation. The employer and the works council may enter into an agreement regarding the
redundancies, but the works council’s consent is not required.
In the event of legal succession of the employer (including a merger or demerger of com-
panies or a transfer of undertaking), the employer must also hold consultations with the
works council on the planned consequences of the legal succession that might affect employ-
ees. Again, the works council's consent is not required.
If the employer employs more than 200 employees full time, at least one third of the su-
pervisory board members of the employer must be elected from among the employees.
Termination of the individual employment contract
In general, an employment contract may be terminated by mutual consent, by termina-
tion, or by termination with immediate effect by the employer or the employee. The termina-
tion of an employment relationship must be in writing.
Termination with immediate effect can occur only if the employee:
 commits a serious breach of a material obligation arising from the employment with in-
tent or by gross negligence or
 exhibits behaviour which makes the continuation of the employment impossible – such as
causing injuries to the employer, being absent from work without a proper excuse or en-
dangering the economic interests of the employer.
The employee may terminate the unlimited term employment at any time by prior notice
without cause. The employer, however, may only terminate unlimited term employment by
termination due to the:
 employee's abilities
 employee's conduct in connection with the job
 employer's business operations.
17Reasons relating to the employee's abilities include, among other things, professional in-
adequacy, health reasons, but also psychological reasons, e.g. inability to get on with co-
workers and superiors. Reasons relating to the conduct of the employee include, among other
things, the violation of workplace and performance rules or the provisions of the employment
contract, refusal to carry out legitimate instructions from superiors and other behaviour vio-
lating the employer's business interests. Reasons relating to the employer's business opera-
tions include, for example, the restructuring or closing of the business operations.
No justification for termination by the employer needs to be given if the employee is be-
yond the statutory retirement age.
In the case of termination, the employment ends on the last day of the notice period. The
statutory notice period is 30 days. Depending on the number of years' continuous service, the
above period increases to a maximum of 60 days after 20 years of employment. The parties
may agree on specific notice periods in the employment contract. These, however, may not
be less than 30 days or more than six months.
In the case of termination by the employer, the employee has to be exempted from their
duties at least for the half the notice period.
Employees who have been employed at the same employer for at least three consecutive
years are entitled to severance pay upon termination by the employer, unless the employee is
a pensioner. The amount of the severance payment depends on the time spent in service
(minimum one month, maximum six months' "absentee fee").
Certain groups of employees enjoy special protection from termination (e.g. employees
on sick leave, employees on maternity leave, etc.).
In the case of fixed-term contracts, the employer may terminate the employment agree-
ment with immediate effect upon payment of one year's absentee fee or an absentee fee for
the remaining period if less than one year of the term of employment remains. In such cases,
no justification need be given for the termination. The employer may terminate the fixed-
term employment agreement: (i) if the employer is subject to bankruptcy proceedings ; (ii) in
connection with the employee's ability to work or (iii) if maintaining the employment relation-
ship becomes impossible due to a force majeure event.
In the case of an unlawful termination of the employment by the employer, the employee
has the right to contest the termination at court within 30 days of receipt of the termination
notice. Should the court establish that the termination was unlawful, the court may, on re-
quest by the employee, reinstate the employee in his former position. In the absence of such
a request, the employee may be awarded an amount equal to the absentee fee for the notice
period. Furthermore, irrespective of the claim for reinstatement, the employer is obliged to
reimburse the employee for his lost wages, any other allowances due and any further proven
damages.
18Redundancies and mass lay-offs
A mass lay-off occurs when an employer having (on average during the previous six
months):
 more than twenty but less than one hundred employees, terminates the employment of
at least ten employees
 more than one hundred but less than three hundred employees, terminates the employ-
ment of at least ten per cent of the employees or
 three hundred or more employees, terminates the employment of at least thirty employ-
ees within a 30-day period based on grounds connected to its business operations or by
mutual consent.
In the event of a mass lay-off, a strict procedure must be followed during which consulta-
tions must be held with the works council (in the course of an agreement can be concluded
between the employer and the works council on the terms of the redundancy) and the na-
tional employment agency must be notified of the relevant information on the planned re-
dundancies.
Foreign employees: work permits and residency permits
Generally, foreign citizens require an employment permit and a residence permit in order
to work legally in Hungary. The employer is entitled to launch the process for the employment
permit on behalf of an employee at the competent employment agency. Obtaining a work
permit generally takes one month, depending on the conditions. A permit is valid for a maxi-
mum term of two years and can be extended for an extra two years. There is a small fee.
No permits are required for EU/EEA citizens and refugees or persons holding resident sta-
tus in Hungary.
If no permit is required for employment, the competent national employment agency
must be notified of the employment by the production of certain information and the em-
ployee must obtain a registration card.
For EU/EEA citizens, no residency permit is required; however, a registration card must be
obtained if they spend more than three months in Hungary. For non-EU/EEA citizens, a resi-
dency permit is required. Generally, obtaining such a permit takes 30–40 days.
An EU "blue card" is a permit for high-educated employees from third countries entitling
the employee to reside and be employed inside any Member State.
19/Economy & Government
Hungary has a medium-sized economy and it is structurally, politically and institutionally
open. Hungary is in Central Europe and is part of the European Union's single market. Like
most Eastern European economies, the Hungarian economy experienced market liberalisation
in the early 1990s as part of the transition from socialist economy to market economy. Hunga-
ry has been a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD ) since 1995, a member of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) since 1996, and a
member of the European Union ( EU) since 2004.
Restrictions/regulations
There are no general restrictions on foreign investments. In certain sectors (e.g. real
property), however, licences may be required. In the case of takeovers, mergers or acquisi-
tions, the approval of the competition authority may be required under competition law.
There are no exchange control or currency regulations in Hungarian law.
Regarding state subsidies, on the one hand Hungary is entitled to approximately €40 bil-
lion from EU funds during the period of 2014–2020, 60% of which will be spent on developing
the Hungarian economy and focusing on R&D&I projects and investments of SMEs, according
to the Government's plans. These incentives are offered to foreign investors in the form of
tenders including the targeted project parameters.
On the other hand, the following main national funded incentive programs are available
for foreign investors:
 VIP cash grant (granted by the individual decision of the Government)
 job creation subsidy (cash grant granted by the individual decision of the Government)
 development tax allowance (exemption from the corporate tax to be paid by a company)
 training subsidy
 subsidy granted for the establishment or development of vocational training centres.
20/Taxation
Tax residency
Resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on their worldwide income.
An individual is deemed to be a resident if they are:
 a Hungarian citizen (except where they have another citizenship and has no permanent or
temporary residence in Hungary)
 a natural person who is present in Hungary for at least 183 days in the relevant calendar
year
 a national of another country or stateless person residing in Hungary if the person is pre-
sent in Hungary for at least 183 days in the relevant year
 a person whose only permanent residence is in Hungary
 centre of vital interests is in Hungary (as determined by family ties and business rela-
tions), if they have no permanent residence in Hungary or elsewhere
 a person whose temporary residence is in Hungary, if their centre of vital interests is un-
known and if they have no permanent residence in Hungary.
Non-resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on Hungarian-source income
if the place of gainful activity is in Hungary or if the income is taxable in Hungary pursuant to
an international agreement or treaty. Hungarian-source income includes income from being a
senior officer or supervisory board member of a legal entity registered in Hungary, and divi-
dends and interest received from Hungarian-registered businesses.
Income tax and social security contributions
Tax resident employees must pay personal income tax of15%.
The tax rate for healthcare contribution is 7% (in kind at 4%, monetary at 3%), a labour
fund (the amount paid is used to help the unemployed sector of the country capable of work-
ing to contribute to the possibility of their future employment) contribution at 1.5% and pen-
sion contribution at 10%.
Non-tax resident employees pay the same taxes and contributions as tax resident em-
ployees but only on Hungarian-source income.
Employers must pay a social contribution of 27%, and a vocational training contribution at
1.5% calculated on the employee's gross monthly wage.
Business vehicles
A business vehicle is tax resident if it is incorporated and registered under Hungarian law.
Foreign legal entities are deemed resident if their place of management is located in Hungary.
A business vehicle is non-tax resident if it is not incorporated and registered under Hun-
garian law but carries out business operations through branches in Hungary.
21Tax-resident companies generally pay corporate income tax of 19% on their worldwide
income. The corporate income tax rate is only 10% up to a positive tax base of HUF 500 mil-
lion (€1.85 million).
VAT is payable at 27% on supplies of goods and services. Certain goods and services listed
in the annexes to the VAT Act are subject to special rates of 5% or 18%, as applicable.
Non-tax resident business vehicles are subject to corporate tax at the same rate as tax
resident businesses but only in respect of income from business activities conducted through
a permanent establishment located in Hungary.
Corporate shareholders are not subject to tax on dividends declared in favour of them, ir-
respective of their residency.
Individual shareholders must pay income tax at 15% on dividends received, unless a dou-
ble tax treaty applies. A corporate shareholder does not have to pay income tax on dividends
received, unless a double tax treaty applies.
The same taxes apply to IP royalties paid as for interest.
Thin capitalisation rules
Thin capitalisation rules apply if the company subject to corporate income tax has obliga-
tions in respect of outstanding loans, outstanding debt securities offered privately or an over-
drawn account.
Under Hungarian thin capitalisation rules, pre-tax profits must be adjusted by adding a
pro rata portion of all interest paid on any of the above obligations that exceed three times
the company's equity capital, with the exception of interest paid to financial institutions
(which are not affiliates). This means that for example in the event that a loan is granted by
the parent company to the Hungarian entity and this loan exceeds the Hungarian Kft's equity
multiplied by three, then the payable interest which falls on the loan exceeding the above lim-
it (i.e. three times the equity of the Hungarian entity) will not be deductible for tax purposes.
Profits of a foreign subsidiary
Companies deemed to be controlled foreign companies are:
1. foreign-resident entities or
2. entities deemed as foreign-resident on account of their place of management, and which
either:
a) have a Hungarian-resident beneficial owner on at least 183 days of the calendar year
or
b) derive more than 50% of their revenues from Hungarian sources in the tax year and
where the effective tax, equivalent to Hungarian corporate income tax, paid by the for-
eign company is:
 below 10% of the company's taxable profits for that accounting period or
22 zero, because the company has a zero or negative tax base, despite making prof-
its for that period.
No CFC rules apply to companies with a registered office or resident status in an EU or
OECD Member State or in a treaty country where the company carries out genuine economic
activities.
The taxable profits of the Hungarian company must be increased by an amount equal to
the controlled foreign company's after-tax profits as at the last day of the tax year less any
dividends paid to its shareholders, provided that the Hungarian shareholder controls at least
25% of the votes or shares or has a controlling interest in the controlled foreign company and
no Hungarian-resident individual holds any interest in that Hungarian-resident shareholder.
Transfer pricing rules
If two or more companies are deemed to be affiliated companies under the Act on Corpo-
rate Tax and Dividend Tax and do not use arm's length prices in the course of their dealings,
the pre-tax profits of the affiliated companies are adjusted to reflect the arm's length price.
The arm's length price is generally determined using the comparable price, the resale
price, the cost plus, the transactional net margin or the profit split methods.
Companies qualifying as small or medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are not required to
apply the above transfer pricing rules to long-term agreements concluded with an affiliated
company, established for the purpose of joint purchases and sales, in which the total voting
rights held by such SME exceed 50%.
Companies not qualifying as SMEs on the last day of the tax year must record the arm's
length price, the method used to determine the arm's length price and the facts and circum-
stances supporting such price until the date of filing their corporate tax returns.
Imports and exports
Exports are subject to zero VAT. Imports are subject to VAT at the applicable rates. The
relevant EC Directives are implemented.
Double tax treaties
Hungary has double tax treaties with all of the original EU Member States and most of the
newly joined EU Member States.
23/Dispute R esolution
Court process
In Hungary, the civil court system has four levels: local courts, regional courts (in Buda-
pest the Budapest Capital Regional Court), regional courts of appeal and the Curia. In civil law
cases the local courts or regional courts have jurisdiction at first instance. Regional courts deal
with cases where the value of the claim exceeds HUF 30 million (approximately €100,000).
Court decisions can in general be appealed and will be heard by the relevant higher court.
In Hungarian civil procedure, legal disputes begin with the filing of a written statement of
claim, including supporting facts and evidence. The court hears the statements of the parties
and the evidence filed, which can include witness testimonies, expert opinions and other ma-
terial evidence. In Hungary, civil lawsuits usually last for several months. Representation by an
attorney is mandatory if the value of the claim exceeds HUF 30 million (approximately
€100,000) and in other cases where the regional courts have jurisdiction in the first instance.
There is no jury trial in Hungary. Judges decide both factual and legal questions and are
fully trained lawyers. Generally, there is a single judge at first instance (in certain cases ac-
companied by two civil assessors) and a panel of three judges at second instance. The Curia
consists of three or five judges, depending on the complexity of the case.
Pre-trial disclosure or class/group actions are not recognised in Hungarian procedural law.
As a general rule, all legal fees of the successful party must be reimbursed by the unsuccessful
party.
Arbitration
In addition to the ordinary court system, arbitration is possible in certain circumstances.
Parties to a contract may agree to submit to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal instead of
an ordinary court. If so, ordinary courts will have no jurisdiction with regard to the dispute.
Arbitration is frequently used by business entities.
The main permanent arbitral tribunals in Hungary are the three Permanent Courts of Ar-
bitration (for Financial and Capital Markets, Telecommunications and the Energy Industry) and
the Court of Arbitration attached to the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The detailed rules, fees and costs of arbitration proceedings are set out in the rules of
procedure of each arbitral tribunal.
Hungary recognises and enforces foreign arbitral awards.
24/Competition
The most important source of Hungarian competition law is Act No. LVII of 1996 on the
prohibition of unfair market practices and restraints of competition ( Competition Act ). The
Competition Act sets out the key provisions concerning:
 the prohibition of restrictive agreements and concerted practices between undertakings
("anti-competitive agreements")
 the prohibition of abuses of a dominant position ("abuse of dominant position") and
 provisions on the control of mergers between undertakings ("merger control").
Anti-competitive agreements
Like European law, section 11(1) of the Competition Act prohibits agreements and con-
certed practices between undertakings as well as decisions by associations of undertakings
which aim to or have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition. Certain
practices are set out in the Competition Act in a (non-exhaustive) list of prohibited measures,
for example, the fixing of prices and conditions; the restriction and control of production, dis-
tribution, technical development and investments; the allocation and limitation of access to
supply sources and customers; the obstruction of market access and the discrimination of cus-
tomers or suppliers as regards price and sales conditions.
De minimis exemption: The prohibition of restrictive agreements does not extend to
agreements of minor significance, i.e. if the parties to the agreement have a joint market
share below 10% during the term of the agreement. The fixing of prices and the allocation of
markets, however, are still prohibited regardless of market share.
Block exceptions: The Hungarian Government is entitled to exempt certain groups of
agreements and concerted practices from the above prohibition if – similar to Article 1(3) of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – the agreement contributes to improv-
ing the production or distribution of goods and services, promotes technical or economic pro-
gress or advances environmental protection or competitiveness, while allowing consumers or
customers a fair share of the resulting benefit and not imposing restrictions on the undertak-
ings concerned that are more than necessary to achieve those objectives and not eliminating
competition in respect of a substantial part of the affected products. Accordingly, various
governmental regulations provide block exemptions for vertical agreements relating to the
repair of cars, insurance agreements, agreements on research and development and the
transfer of technology. The Hungarian regulations are only applicable if the agreements do
not affect the Common Market (in which case they would be governed by the equivalent Eu-
ropean regulations).
Special exemptions: Special regulations may be applicable in the agricultural sector,
where the ministry in charge may establish that reasonable justifications exist to exempt an
25agreement from the applicable competitive regime. Also, in the agricultural sector, the com-
petition authority may oblige the parties concerned to bring their commercial practices in line
with the applicable competition regime, prior to imposing fines.
Participants in anti-competitive agreements may apply for leniency under the leniency
policy set out in the Competition Act. The first participant to inform the Competition Authority
about the anti-competitive agreements and provide satisfactory evidence of its existence and
participants may receive amnesty. The second, third or fourth participants may receive reduc-
tions in the fine the Competition Authority might impose on them.
Abuse of dominant position
Hungarian competition law also prohibits the abuse of a dominant position by an under-
taking. The Competition Act provides a non-exhaustive list of business practices which are
considered abusive, such as applying unfair prices and sales conditions; requesting unreason-
able benefits for the company against the customer (typically excessive costs for a service)
and imposing disadvantageous conditions upon customers; restricting production, distribution
and technical development to the detriment of consumers and customers; refusing or with-
holding goods from the market with the purpose of increasing their price or to obtain other
unreasonable advantages; discriminating arbitrarily between customers in similar business
dealings; applying unreasonably low prices which are not justified by increased efficiency; and
restricting and obstructing entry into the market by other undertakings, etc.
In contrast to certain other jurisdictions, the Competition Act does not set out a specific
market share threshold above which an undertaking is considered to have a dominant posi-
tion. Instead, the existence of a dominant position is determined in each particular case, tak-
ing into account the financial, technical and legal barriers and risks associated with entering or
leaving the market, the financial resources of the undertaking concerned and the structure of
the affected market and, in particular, competitors' market shares and their conduct as well as
the economic influence exerted by the undertaking concerned on the affected market.
Merger control
The Competition Act also regulates the procedure for controlling mergers between com-
panies. If the turnover thresholds of the Competition Act are met and the merger does not fall
within the jurisdiction of the European Commission, a merger between undertakings will re-
quire the Hungarian Competition Authority's ( HCA – Gazdasági Versenyhivatal) prior approval.
Hungarian merger control also extends to mergers between foreign companies if the Hungari-
an market is affected. Hungarian merger control is mandatory and supervisory, so if a merger
is completed without prior clearance by the HCA, the undertakings concerned may be severely
fined. Further, the HCA may also order the breakup of the merged undertaking if the merger
would have not qualified for clearance.
The material test in Hungarian merger control is a combination of the "significant lessen-
ing of competition" test which is meant to point out the possible changes in the relative
26strength of the competition on the affected market together with the "dominance" test, i.e.
the creation or strengthening of a dominant position in the affected market.
Penalties and fines
Breaches of the Competition Act may be subject to fines from HCA. The maximum fine is
10% of the undertaking's turnover in the previous business year.
Furthermore, anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices in connection with
public procurement procedures are considered a criminal offence and individuals could face
imprisonment for up to five years.
Private enforcement
Hungarian legislation recognises the importance of privately enforcing damage claims
arising out of anti-competitive arrangements. Accordingly, the Competition Act contains cer-
tain rules which aim to reduce burdens for claimants. In particular, decisions by the HCA as
well as the European Commission are sufficient to establish an infringement in the context of
a follow-on damages action. Furthermore, the Competition Act provides a presumption (re-
buttable for both the claimant and defendant) that a hard-core cartel resulted in a price in-
crease of 10% in order to facilitate damages calculations, and thus eases the burden of proof
regarding the damage caused by the cartel.
27/Intellectual P roperty
Intellectual property rights can be divided into two categories: industrial property rights
and copyright. Industrial property rights include patents, trademarks, designs, plant variety,
utility model and topography protection, as well as the protection of geographical indications.
Copyright covers literary and artistic works as well as related rights protecting artists or eco-
nomic investors contributing to the dissemination of the works to the public (performers,
producers of phonograms, broadcasters).
How to obtain protection?
In order to obtain protection for industrial property, an official protection procedure must
be followed including registration in the Patent Register by the official body responsible for
the management of industrial property rights.
The protection of copyright does not require a registration procedure since copyright pro-
tection exists as soon as the work is created.
Extent of protection
Intellectual property creates exclusive rights which, similar to property rights, ensure pro-
tection against all others for the creators of intellectual works by recognising and safeguarding
their economic and moral rights.
Industrial property rights
Patent protection lasts for 20 years from the day on which the patent application is filed
and applies solely in the countries where the protection was granted.
A Hungarian patent may be obtained by national or European application or by an appli-
cation submitted within the framework of the Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT), provided that
the application and the invention comply with the relevant statutory requirements.
Trademark protection lasts for 10 years from the date of filing the application. However,
protection may be extended by further 10-year periods at the registered owner's request.
As a fundamental rule, the author's rights are protected for his lifetime and 70 years af-
terwards. After the death of the author, the rights may be exercised by the author's heirs. In
the case of works created by joint authors, cinematographic creations and when the author
cannot be identified, the length of protection is determined in a different way.
An author may license the use of his work in return for consideration (the "copyright" it-
self is not transferable, only the use of it). The legal provisions concerning licence agreements
are found in the Copyright Act. There are two basic rules that must be followed in any licence
agreement: (i) the exploitation rights cannot be licensed for an indefinite period of time and
(ii), the specific exploitation right must be set out in the agreement. The Copyright Act regu-
lates publishing agreements and licence agreements concerning software and cinematograph-
28ic creations as further special types of agreements. Besides copyright provisions, the provi-
sions of the Civil Code on agreements must also be applied to licence agreements.
Enforcement
The Copyright Act and other statutes set out a large variety of ways to enforce intellectual
property rights. If an infringement of rights has occurred, the rightsholder may seek a remedy
under civil or criminal law (e.g. plagiarism, infringement of copyright and certain rights related
to copyright, compromising or defrauding the integrity of technological measures for the pro-
tection of copyright and certain rights related to copyright, falsifying data related to copyright
management, violation of industrial design rights) or initiate the customs protection, i.e. sei-
zure. The rightsholder may take legal action and claim (i) the Court's declaration of the in-
fringement; (ii) cessation of the infringement; (iii) compensation from the infringer; (iv) sur-
render of any enrichment obtained through the infringement; (v) communication of
information concerning the infringement; (vi) seizure of the means used for the infringement
and of infringing products; (vii) measures by the customs authorities to prevent free circula-
tion of infringing goods; and (viii) damages.
29/Marketing A greements
Agency agreements
In Hungary, agency agreements are governed by the Civil Code, which implements Di-
rective 86/653/EEC on self-employed commercial agents.
The primary obligation of a commercial agent is to negotiate agreements on the sale of
goods or otherwise concerning goods on behalf of his principal. It should be noted, however,
that a commercial agent acts as an independent contractor, rather than an employee. Gener-
ally, a commercial agent is not authorised to conclude agreements, but the parties may agree
otherwise. The principal is obliged to pay remuneration for the activities of the commercial
agent and provide the agent with the necessary documentation and materials.
The parties to an agency agreement are entitled to stipulate a restraint of trade clause.
Such a clause is valid only if it is concluded in writing, lasts for not more than two years after
termination of the agency agreement, specifies the remuneration and relates to the scope of
activity covered by the agency relationship in the contract.
Distribution agreements
Only basic elements of distribution agreements are regulated by the Hungarian Civil Code.
The Civil Code contains model clauses which apply by virtue of law to all distribution agree-
ments, including supply of products or of services. However, deviation from the model clauses
is possible in all cases. The key model clauses are described below:
 Protection of good reputation: According to the new Civil Code the distributor is obliged
to protect the good reputation of the supplier
 Instructions & control: The supplier is entitled to instruct the distributor and control the
performance of the distributor. However, if the instructions given by the supplier are un-
reasonable or inappropriate, the distributor is obliged to warn it, and any damage result-
ing from maintaining the instructions despite the warning will be the liability of the sup-
plier.
Franchising
Franchising agreements are regulated by the Hungarian Civil Code. With regard to fran-
chising agreements, the Civil Code contains model clauses which apply by virtue of law to all
franchising agreements. However, deviation from the model clauses is possible in all cases. In
the following the key model clauses are described:
 The franchisor is required to ensure that the franchisee has ongoing and uninterrupted
access to the use, utilisation and exploitation rights that are required for running the
franchise during the full term of the contract. The franchisee is required to take measures
to protect the know-how placed at its disposal.
30 Supply obligation: If the franchisor is obliged to supply the franchisee with the goods to
be sold or to supply basic materials for the production of goods and the franchisor fails to
fulfil the franchisee's order, the franchisee will be entitled to obtain the goods or the
basic materials from other sources.
 Protection of good reputation: The franchisee is obliged to protect the good reputation of
the franchisor.
 Instructions & control: The franchisor is entitled to instruct the franchisee and monitor
the franchisee's performance. However, if the instructions given by the franchisor are un-
reasonable or inappropriate, the franchisee is obliged to warn him and any damage re-
sulting from maintaining the instructions despite the warning will be the liability of the
franchisor.
It should be noted that competition and anti-trust restrictions apply in the case of fran-
chise agreements, as they are subject to the Act against Restrictions on Competition and EU
competition law with the exceptions under the "Pronuptia" ruling of the ECJ.
31/E-commerce
The key Hungarian law on e-commerce is the Act on Electronic Commerce and Infor-
mation Society Services, Act CVIII of 2001 ( E-Commerce Act ).
The E-Commerce Act regulates "information society services" rendered from Hungary or
directed from abroad to Hungary. The E-Commerce Act has a wide scope and applies to a very
wide variety of electronic services provided at a distance (particularly e-commerce services).
With regard to e-commerce contracts, the Act sets out conditions which must be followed
in the course of the provision of e-commerce services. Contracts entered into by means of
simple electronic correspondence (i.e. email and related technologies) are excluded from
these legal provisions and in the case of non-consumer e-commerce contracts, parties can
derogate from these conditions.
In addition to the above, the E-Commerce Act contains special provisions on
e-advertisements.
The Hungarian Decree on Consumer Contracts (Decree No 45/2014) – implementing
EU Directive 2011/83/EU – applies to consumer distance selling contracts. Non-consumer con-
tracts are generally exempted from the protective measures of this decree. The decree pro-
tects the interests of consumers by provisions such as the statutory cancellation right for con-
sumers without prior notice within 14 days of contracting or delivery, subject to further
conditions beyond the scope of this booklet.
The Hungarian Act on E-signatures (Act XXXV of 2001) sets out the statutory conditions
for using authorised e-signatures in certain circumstances, such as company registration pro-
cedures. Where the law requires a statement to be put in writing, an electronic document
furnished with an advanced security e-signature will have an identical effect.
32/Data P rotection
The Privacy Act (Act No CXII of 2011 on Informational Self-Determination and Freedom of
Information ( Privacy Act )) contains the key principles with regard to the authorised processing
of personal data. According to this key principles, personal data (meaning in broad terms all
data related in some way to data subjects, i.e. natural persons) may only be processed (i) with
the prior consent of the data subjects or (ii) in limited cases with the prior authorisation by
law. Since Hungarian law provides for statutory rights to process personal data only in limited
cases (see point (ii) above), the data subject's consent must be obtained in most cases.
One of the important provisions of the Privacy Act is that personal data may also be pro-
cessed without the prior consent of the data subject, provided that it is impossible or requires
disproportionate effort to obtain the data subject's consent. However, this exemption is only
applicable if data processing is necessary (i) for the data controller to comply with a legal obli-
gation, or (ii) for the data controller to assert its legitimate interests and such interests are not
overridden by fundamental privacy principles. Further, if personal data has been collected and
processed on the basis of a data subject's consent, such data may continue to be processed
even if the data subject revokes his or her consent, as long as either condition (i) or (ii) above
is met (note: the above provisions aim to implement Article 7c) and f) of Directive 95/46/EC).
It should be highlighted in this respect that data subjects must be informed about all rele-
vant aspects of the processing of their data because informed consent is required. This also
means that even if the data subject has provided prior consent, personal data may only be
processed within the scope of the actual and agreed data collection activity.
The Privacy Act established a new Data Protection Supervisory Authority ( DPA ) replacing
the previous Data Commissioner. The new authority has an increased scope of activity, such
as powerful investigative authority and the right to impose fines.
Significant changes were introduced in the field of data protection in 2015. The Hungarian
Parliament has amended the Privacy Act. The most important amendments of the Privacy Act
are described below.
A new tool, the binding corporate rules ( BCRs ), has been introduced in the amendment.
BCRs are intra-group company global privacy policies which set out standard internal proce-
dures and comply with EU data protection requirements. According to the new rules Hungari-
an companies and multinational company groups with Hungarian subsidiaries may – subject
to completing the approval procedure before the DPA – rely on BCRs when transferring per-
sonal data with their group. The approval procedure takes 60 days and the administrative fee
is HUF 266,000 (approximately €900).
In order to help individuals inform on any wrongdoings involving their personal data and
to facilitate DPA investigations, all data controllers are required to maintain a register of data
33breaches for at least five years. It is not necessary, however, to notify the authority of such
breaches.
The upper limit of monetary fines that may be imposed by the DPA has been increased to
HUF 20 million (approximately €65,000).
Several other acts (decrees) contain additional data protection provisions. For example,
personal data collected for the purposes of direct marketing and research is regulated by
Act CXIX of 1995. Also, the E-Commerce Act (see above) contains special data protection pro-
visions.
A gross infringement of data protection provisions may in some cases lead to criminal lia-
bility and can constitute a criminal offence (the relevant legal provisions are found in the Hun-
garian Criminal Code).
34/Product L iability
Product liability is now mainly regulated by the Civil Code implementing Directive 85/374/
EEC). The Civil Code provides that the manufacturer of the defective product is liable for dam-
age caused by the product defect and allows only few defences, e.g. the manufacturer did not
put the product into circulation, the product was not manufactured or distributed in the
course of the manufacturer's business or the defect could not be discovered at the time the
product was put into circulation according to the scientific and technical knowledge. A prod-
uct is defective if it fails to provide the level of safety generally expected. The term "manufac-
turer" is defined widely, and covers manufacturers in different phases of production. Apart
from the person attaching their name/trademark, the importer or the distributor can be held
liable. Examples of damage which may be subject to compensation are: damage resulting in
death, bodily injury or health damage. Property damage, other than damage to the defective
product itself, exceeding the equivalent of €500 in the Hungarian currency is recoverable if
the other property is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption and was
usually used by the injured person for such purposes.
Product liability claims can be made under contract and tort law or other claims stipulat-
ed by law, in addition those under the Civil Code.
The general rules on product safety, applying to products that are intended for or made
accessible to consumers are set out in Act CLV of 1997 (on Consumer Protection ( CPA), im-
plementing Directive 2001/95/EC) and Act LXXXVIII of 2012. In addition, specific safety rules
apply to certain product groups, e.g. pharmaceuticals under Act XCV of 2005 and Decree
No. 52/2005 of the Minister of Healthcare.
The CPA and Act LXXXVIII of 2012 establish public law duties for the manufacturers of
consumer products, e.g. marking the product with appropriate labels, monitoring product
safety on a regular basis, investigating complaints raised in connection with product safety
and withdrawing or recalling the product from the market.
Non-compliance with product safety requirements can be punished by the competent
market surveillance authorities. Non-compliance with the CPA may be enforced by ordering
the withdrawal or recall of the unsafe product or by levying fines.
35/Bribery & Corpo rate C rime
Bribery is punishable under Act C of 2012 on the Hungarian Criminal Code, either commit-
ted in the public or the private sector, or committed actively or passively. Bribery may give
rise to imprisonment for between one and five years (in certain qualified cases up to ten
years). Criminal liability attaches to both the bribery of civil servants as well as directors and
employees of companies and associations. Bribing directors and employees of foreign compa-
nies as well as civil servants of foreign countries and organisations also qualifies as a crime.
Note that criminal liability attaches to the active conduct of bribing any of the above or re-
questing a bribe or another advantage. This also applies to the passive acceptance of, and the
agreement with, another person's demand for such bribe.
The European Money Laundering Directive has been incorporated into Hungarian law by
Act CXXXVI of 2007 on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism
(Money Laundering Act ). According to the provisions of the Money Laundering Act, compa-
nies in the financial sector, auditors, tax advisors, attorneys, notaries, casino operators and
traders of precious metals have to identify their customers and monitor and report suspicious
transactions. Failing to comply with the above reporting obligation qualifies as a criminal of-
fence and may give rise to up to two years imprisonment.
Assisting or participating in transactions relating to money laundering activities is also
deemed a criminal offence and may result in imprisonment for up to eight years.
In general, only acts of individuals are subject to criminal liability, and thus only individu-
als may be subject to criminal punishments relating to their criminal liability. Certain criminal
measures, however, can be made against companies as well if the crime – committed by a di-
rector, supervisory board member, employee or member etc. in their scope of duties – aimed
to obtain any kind of advantage for the company. These kinds of criminal measures against
companies can range from imposing a fine or restriction of activity to their compulsory termi-
nation.
36/Real E state
Based on the provisions of Act CXXII of 2013 on Transactions in Agricultural and Forestry
Land, Hungarian or foreign entities and non-EU nationals are not allowed to acquire owner-
ship of agricultural land, whereas EU nationals may now acquire agricultural land if they meet
the requirements set forth in the Act.
Foreign individuals and legal entities registered in the European Union may own any oth-
er real property without any further restrictions.
Acquisition of real estate by foreign individuals and legal entities registered outside the
European Union is subject to the approval of the relevant governmental body, as set out in
Government Decree No. 251/2014.
Freehold and leasehold are not recognised concepts in Hungarian law, i.e. ownership
rights are not limited in time.
Ownership of real estate may either be by co-ownership or sole ownership. In the case of
co-ownership, all owners have a theoretical ownership ratio in relation to the property which
is the basis of decision-making voting rights and costs.
Condominium ownership is a combination of the two forms: certain parts of the property
are solely owned, while other parts are co-owned by the owners.
With certain legal exceptions, the ownership of land and of the building on the land can-
not be separated.
Other interests may also be registered in relation to real property, for example:
 A "right of usufruct" is a right for a person to hold and use a certain asset and to benefit
from its products, without having the right to dispose of the property
 A "right of use" is a particular type of the right of usufruct, and, like the latter, is the right
for a person to hold and use a certain asset to the extent that it serves himself and his
family members
 An "easement" is the right to use a part of a real property of another without possessing
it. Easements require the existence of at least two parties.
Certain rights set out in Act CXLI of 1997 may only be validly created by registration in the
land register. These rights are: ownership based on transfer, asset management rights, use of
land, usufruct and the right of use, easement and mortgages based on contract.
This means that the transfer of ownership of a property is only effective if registered in
the land register.
For the purpose of valid registration, sale agreements need to be either countersigned by
a lawyer or prepared by a notary public in the form of a notarial deed.
37The transfer of real property is subject to transfer tax, payable by the purchaser.
The standard transfer tax rate is 4% on the part of the purchase price up to HUF 1 billion
(approximately €3.2 million) and 2% on the excess part, up to a maximum of HUF 200 million
(approximately €630,000).
For properties registered as apartments, the transfer tax is 4% of the difference between
the purchase prices of the apartment bought by the buyer and the previous apartment sold by
the buyer if the sale of the previous apartment is within one year of the purchase of the new
apartment.
The general rule is that the transfer of real property between legal entities is subject to
VAT, with certain exceptions defined by law.
Existing law is stated as it applied in January 2015.

1. HUNGARY  
1.1 General Introduction  
Hungary has gradually been successful in seizing the opportunity to close the gap 
between itself and the world’s more developed regions. The economy has been 
transformed from a centrally planned to a functioning market economy and the 
essential democratic politica l institutions have also been established. The country 
is politically and economically integrated into the prestigious group of developed 
countries, it is a member of the European Union, NATO and various important 
international organizations.  
As a result of these changes and the developing economy, Hungary has become a 
country, capable of offering numerous opportunities to businessmen. Because of 
its central location between Western - and Eastern Europe it provides access to 
almost the entire European marke t and as a consequence of the moderate wage 
rates, high level of education, the investment friendly legal rules and taxation 
system, Hungary has become an ideal location with exceptional circumstances and 
conditions to pursue various business investments. This prospectus introduces you 
to the realities and the essential background of doing business in Hungary.  
 
1.2 Political system  
Hungary is a parliamentary democracy, which means that the legislative power is 
in the hand of the Parliament. Only the Parliament is entitled to enact laws, 
however the Hungarian government, its members and the local authorities also 
have the power to iss ue decrees in certain areas, as long as these decrees do not 
contradict Parliamentary  legislation. The members of Parliament are elected in 
multiparty elections by popular vote under a system of proportional and direct 
representation to serve four -year ter ms. 
The government has the necessary executive powers to execute the acts of the 
Parliament  and other legal regulations. The head of the government is the Prime 
Minister, who is elected by Parliament on the recommendation of the President of 
the Republic.  The President of the Republic is elected by Parliament for a 
maximum  of two, five year terms. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution 
the President has restricted executive powers and an important role as the 
representative of the Nation. Among oth ers, he has an extensive nomination right, 
as he is entitled to conclude international agreements, he may countersign or veto 
and return the acts enacted by the Parliament and is the commander in chief of the 
army. In addition to central government, the co untry also has a local governmental 
structure with separated legislative and executive powers. These local 
municipalities consist of the municipality of Budapest, nineteen counties and 
several other local municipalities.

1.3 Economy  
In the last twenty years the centrally planned market economy was successfully 
transformed to a functioning market economy. Efficient laws have been put in 
place in the fields of bankruptcy, accounting, banking, taxation and company law, 
particularly in re lation to company structure and operation. The stock exchange , 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions have been established 
and are now functioning independently, as their private ownership is assured and 
protected through recently en acted legislation. Free competition is secure and 
thriving as a result of the harmonization of relevant Hungarian legislation to the 
EU directives.  
Foreign investments are sincerely welcome in Hungary, thus, various legal and 
financial advantages are bein g provided to assist them in establishing and 
operating successful business models. Citizens of other nations may, under the 
same conditions as Hungarian citizens, pursue any business activities, such as to 
establish companies or branch offices of their fo reign company, to acquire 
ownership in Hungarian companies and so on. Furthermore, any company 
registered in Hungary, regardless of the structure or nationality of its ownership, is 
treated on an equal basis (“national treatment”). As a direct result of th e abo ve 
mentioned conditions, foreign ownership and investment  is widespread in 
Hungarian businesses.  
The country is thoroughly integrated into world economy. The largest proportion 
of its trade is conducted with the members of the European  Union. Economi c 
relations with overseas countries like the United States of America, Japan, China, 
India are also well established.

2. FOREIGN INVESTMENT R EGULATIONS AND CORPO RATE REGIME 
IN HUNGARY  
2.1 Foreign Investment Regulations  
Generally, pursuant to Act XXIV of 1988 on the Investments of Foreigners  in 
Hungary, foreigners may engage in or conduct business activities in Hungary or may 
engage in business operation by creating a presence for business purposes in 
Hungary (e.g. a comp any, a branch, etc.).  
2.2 Corporate regime  
The Hungarian Parliament adopted Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code (the “Civil 
Code”) effective as of March 15, 2014, which replaced the previous civil law regime 
in Hungary. The Civil Code partly assimilated the rule s of the former companies 
legislation (i.e. Act IV of 2006 on Business Organizations (the “Companies Act”)), 
and partly introduced new rules. The Civil Code intends to increase creditor’s 
security and generally create legal certainty with respect to the op eration of business 
organizations.  
In addition to the Civil Code, Act V of 2006 on the Public Company Information, 
Company Registration and Winding -up Proceedings (the “Court Procedures Act”), 
sets out the rules on trade registry and winding -up procedure s applicable to 
companies. The Hungarian parliament is expected to adopt within a year a new 
procedural act and a new, separate act on the voluntary winding up of companies. 
The aim of these new acts is to simplify the procedures and to provide more clarit y 
on certain issues (such as e.g. harmonizing the general management disqualification 
rules now spread over in various acts).  
2.3 Business Organizations  
2.3.1 Founders  
Business organizations can be established by Hungarian resident and non -resident 
natural and legal persons to jointly engage in business operations. Further, such 
persons can join business organizations as members or acquire participation therein . 
Except for limited liability companies and the private joint stock company, at least 
two members are required for the establishment of a business organization.  
2.3.2 Forms  of business organizations  
Business organizations can only be established in the company forms r egulated in 
the Civil Code. Currently, the following types of business organizations can be 
established under the Civil Code:  
 
(a) limited liability company (in Hungarian: “korlátolt felelősségű 
társaság”, i.e. “Kft.”);  
11 (b) private joint stock company (in Hungarian: “zártkörűen működő 
részvénytársaság”, i.e. “Zrt.”);  
(c) general partnership (in Hungarian: “közkereseti társaság”, i.e. “Kkt.”);  
(d) limited partnership (in Hungarian: “betéti társaság”, i.e. “Bt. “).  
After the coming into effect of the Civil Code as of March 15, 2014, public joint 
stock companies may no longer be established. Joint ventures (in Hungarian: 
“közös vállalat”) can not be established since 1 July 2006.  
2.4 General attributes of business organizations  
2.4.1 Limited Liability Companies  (“Korlátolt Felelősségű Társaság” or “Kft. “)  
(a) General rules  
A Kft is a business organization which is established with a 
predetermined amount of initial capital provided by the quotaholders . 
Securities can not be issued to incorporate the equity contributions of 
the quotaholders, but those are represented by the so called “quotas”. In 
line with the above, members of a limited liability company are called 
quotaholders and not shareholders.  
(b) Capitalization requirements  
The minimum capital required to establish a limited liability company is 
HUF 3 million (approx. JPY 1,400,000).  The registered capital consists 
of the capital contributions of the quotaholders, which can be a 
contribution in cas h or in kind or both. A limited liability company may 
be established solely by contribution in kind. Specific rules are 
applicable to the amount of the contribution, which must be provided 
prior to the date of the submission with the trade registry of the 
registration application; the amount  of the contribution depends on 
whether it is provided in cash or in kind, and whether the newly found 
company is a multi -quotaholder or a wholly -owned entity.  
(c) Liability of quotaholders  
In general, the liability of the quotaholders of the company extend only 
to the provision of their capital contributions and other contributions set 
out in the articles of association, and usually they are not held 
responsible for the liabilities of the co mpany.  
 
 
(d) Transfer of the quota  
12 Most quotas are freely transferrable among the quotaholders of the 
company, excluding the company’s own quotas. Quotaholders  may grant 
to each other pre -emptive rights in the articles of association, or may 
restrict or add conditions to the transfer of the quota to third persons by 
other means.  
 
The quotaholders of the company, the company or a person designated by 
the quotahol ders’ meeting has, in this order, pre -emption rights for quotas 
to be transferred to third party by means of a quota sale and purchase 
agreement, provided that such right is not precluded or restricted by the 
articles of association.  
In case of the sale o f quota by means of a sale and purchase agreement, a 
quotaholder wishing to purchase the quota by exercising its pre -emptive 
right, must announce his/her position within 15 days from the date of the 
selling quotaholder’s communication of the sale offer. If  the quotaholder 
does not make any announcement within said deadline, its pre -emptive 
rights shall be considered as waived. The deadline to respond to such offer 
is 30 days for the company and for the person designated by the company.  
 
2.4.2 Joint Stock Compani es (“Részvénytársaság” or “Rt.”)  
(a) General Rules  
A joint stock company is a business organization established with a 
predetermined amount of share capital, represented by shares of a 
predetermined number and nominal value. The liability of the 
shareholders  of a joint stock company is limited to the value of their 
contribution to the joint stock company’s share capital, i.e. to the value 
of their share(s).  
 
With respect to the form of operation of joint stock companies, two 
types of joint stock companies ca n be distinguished.  
 
Private Joint Stock Company  
A private joint stock company shall mean a company  whose shares are 
not offered to the public, also any joint stock company whose shares 
were originally offered to the public but are no longer available to  the 
general public, or were removed from trading on a regulated market. In 
addition, any joint stock company, having one shareholder, or becoming 
a wholly -owned company must operate in the form of a private joint 
stock company.  
  
13  
Public Joint Stock Comp any 
After the coming into effect of the Civil Code as of March 15, 2014, 
public joint stock companies may no longer be established. 
Notwithstanding this restriction, the shares of private joint stock 
companies may still be admitted for trading on a regula ted market, 
following which the company will continue to operate as a public joint 
stock company. Accordingly, a company may operate as a public joint 
stock company only if its shares have been admitted for trading on a 
regulated market.  
 
(b) Capitalization Requirements  
Private Joint Stock Company  
A private joint stock company is established upon the signing by the 
founders of the articles of association of the company and the 
commitment of the founders to subscribe for all shares issued by the 
company.  
The registered capital of a private joint stock company shall not be less 
than HUF 5 million ( approx. JPY  2,300,000). Pri vate joint stock 
companies can be also established with cash -contribution and/or with in -
kind contributions, but the amount of cash con tributions at the time of 
foundation may not be less than thirty per cent of the issued share 
capital.  
Public Joint Stock Company  
The registered capital of a public joint stock company shall be at least  
HUF 20 million (approx. JPY 9,100,000).  
2.4.3 General partnership (“Közkereseti társaság” or “Kkt.”)  
The general partnership is a business organization whose members are jointly 
engaged in business operations with unlimited and joint and several liability, and 
provide to the partnership the capital contribut ion necessary for the activities of 
the partnership.  
In principle, profits and losses shall be distributed among the members in 
proportion to their capital contribution.  
The supreme body of a general partnership is the meeting of members, in the 
activity  of which all members shall take part.  
The management of general partnerships shall be conducted by one or more 
managing directors, elected from among the members. If no managing director has 
been elected, all members are considered as managing directors.  Any provision in 
the articles of association appointing (or allowing the appointment of) a non -
member to be a managing director, shall be null and void.  
  
14 In general, the partnership shall be liable for its obligations with its own assets. 
However, if it s assets do not cover its obligations, members of the partnership 
shall have unlimited, joint and several liability with their private property.  
If the number of the members of the partnership decreases to one, the partnership 
must report at least one new  member to the court of registration within 6 months. 
Failure to do so will result in the termination of the partnership.  
2.4.4 Limited partnership ( “Betéti társaság” or “Bt.”)  
The limited partnership is a business organization which shall has at least two 
members: one general partner and one limited partner.  
Members of a limited partnership shall undertake to jointly engage in business 
operations, where the liability of at least one member (the general partner) for the 
obligations not covered by the assets  of the partnership is unlimited, and is joint 
and several with all other general partners, while at least one other member 
(limited partner) is only obliged to provide capital contribution and, in principle, is 
not liable for the obligations of the partne rship.  
A limited partner, who used to be the limited partnership’s general partner, shall 
remain liable for the obligations of the partnership not covered by its assets for 5 
years from the change of his title for the limited partnership’s liabilities aga inst 
third parties if such liabilities originated at the time when such partner was general 
partner of the limited partnership.  
In principle, profits and losses shall be distributes among the members in 
proportion to their capital contributions.  
If the number of the members of the partnership decreases to one, the partnership 
shall report at least one new member to the court of registration within 6 months. 
Failure to do so results in the termination of the partnership.  
2.4.5  Hungarian Commercial Repres entative Office of a Foreign Company 
(“Kereskedelmi képviselet” or “CRO” ) 
The establishment of a CRO is governed principally by the provisions of (i) Act 
CXXXII of 1997 on Branches and Commercial Representative Offices of Foreign 
Enterprises, as amended (the “CRO Act”), and (ii) the Court Procedures Act.  
(a) Permitted Scope of Activities  
The CRO Act recognizes and authorizes the “CRO” as a legal form 
through which the following enities may operate in Hungary:  
  
15  a foreign legal person,  
 a foreign organization having no legal personality, and  
 other entrepreneurs registered abroad  
(each referred to as a “Founder”).   
The CRO Act permits the CRO to perform only the following activities:  
 mediate contracts  
 prepare contracts  
 perform information, advertisement and promotional 
activities.  
However, the CRO must not engage in any other, entrepreneurial  or 
business activities.  
The CRO - being an entity without legal personality - acts in the name 
of and on behalf of the Founder.  Thus, t he CRO is entitled to enter into 
contracts only in the name of and on behalf of the Founder and only in 
connection with matters relating to the operation of the CRO.  
Therefore, for example, the CRO Act provides that persons working for 
the CRO as employee s or service providers, as the case may be, actually 
have a contractual relationship with the Founder.  
(b) Existence  
The CRO Act states that a CRO comes into existence when the relevant 
court of registration, having jurisdiction according to the registered s eat 
of the CRO, registers  the CRO in the trade registry. The CRO may 
commence  its operations and may engage in legally permitted activities 
only following its registration in the trade registry.  
(c) Representation of the CRO  
The right to represent the CRO  may be granted to persons who  
(i) are employed by or assigned to the CRO, or  
(ii) have a Hungarian domestic residence and have concluded a 
contract for services (i.e. a civil law contract) with the CRO.  
Thus, it is possible to appoint the executive officer(s) of the Founder as 
representative(s) of the CRO only if such person(s) have an employment 
relationship or assignment or contract for services with the Founder.  
2.4.6.  Hungarian Branch of a Foreign Co mpany  
The establishment of a branch is governed principally by the provisions of (i) the 
CRO Act, and (ii) the Court Procedures Act.  
The CRO  Act recognizes and authorizes the “branch” as an entity form (without 
legal personality) through which the following may operate in Hungary:  
16 (a) a foreign legal person,  
(b) a foreign organization having no legal personality, and  
(c) other entrepreneurs registered abroad  
 
(each referred to as a “Founder”).  
The CRO  Act states that a branch comes into existence when the relevant court of 
registration, having jurisdiction according to the registered seat of the branch, 
registers the branch in the trade registry. The branch may commence its operations 
and may engage in  legally permitted activities only following its registration in the 
trade registry. However, the authorized signatories may proceed in the name and 
on behalf of the branch after the branch submits its application for registration to 
the competent Court of  Registration, in which case the words “registration in 
process” must be included in the branch’s name and on all correspondence and 
documents issued by or signed on behalf of the branch during the period between 
the date of submission of the registration application and the date of the 
registration.  
Prior to its registration in the trade registry, the branch may not engage in any 
activities which require official authorization and/or the conduct of which requires 
a license (including activities relating t o purchase and lease of business premises).  
The CRO Act provides that a branch may be registered in the trade registry if its 
registration application and its required appendices comply with the requirements 
prescribed in the Registration Act and in other  laws.  
The branch may be represented by persons who  
(i) are employed by or assigned to the branch or  
(ii) have a Hungarian domestic residence and have concluded a contract for 
services (i.e. a civil law contract) with the branch.  
According to the CRO  Act, the persons who are employed by the branch - 
employees /representatives (as the case may be) - are in legal relationship with the 
Founder. Thus, it is possible to appoint the executive officer(s) of the Founder as 
representative(s) of the branch if t hese executive officer(s) are in an employment 
relationship with the Founder. Not all executive officers of the Founder are 
required to be named in the Hungarian trade registry as representatives of the 
branch.  We recommend that at least those two or thre e executive officers who are 
most likely to be called on to sign on behalf of the Founder documents relating to 
the branch should be named (registered).  
The right to represent a branch includes the right to sign documents binding on 
that branch.  
  
17 2.4.7  European Public Liability Companies  
At an EU -level, European Public Limited Liability Companies are regulated by 
Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European Company 
(SE).  
Public limited -liability companies formed under the law of a  Member State, with 
registered offices and head offices within the Community may form an SE by 
means of a merger provided that at least two of them are governed by the law of 
different Member States.  
In addition to this, public and private limited -liabili ty companies formed under the 
law of a Member State, with registered offices and head offices within the 
Community may promote the formation of a holding SE provided that each or at 
least two of them:  
(a) is governed by the law of a different Member State , or 
(b) has had, for at least two years, a subsidiary company governed by the 
law of another Member State or a branch situated in another Member 
State.  
The subscribed capital of an SE shall not be less than EUR 120,000; the capital 
shall be expressed in  Euro.  
The capital of an SE shall be divided into shares. No shareholder shall be liable for 
more than the amount he has subscribed.  
 
2.5 General rules on the operation of business organizations  
2.5.1 Business activities  
A business organization may pursue any business activities that are not prohibited 
or restricted by law or government decree. Certain specific economic activities set 
out by Hungarian laws can only be pursued in specific company forms. Just to 
mention an example, banks can only be established i n the form of a joint stock 
company.  
2.5.2 Registered seat  
All business organizations must have a registered seat. The registered office of a 
business organization generally functions as the business organization’s 
headquarters. The registered office also functions as the business organization’s 
mailing address, where all business and official documents are received, filed, 
safeguarded and archived, and where the obligations set out in specific other 
legislation for corporate headquarters are satisfied. Cor porate headquarters are to 
be marked by a company sign.  
 
 
 
18 2.5.3 Representation and Signatory Rights  
“Power of representation” means authority to represent a business organization by 
signing in its name and on its behalf.  
Signature authority may be conferred on a single person or on several persons 
acting jointly. If conferred upon several persons, the form of authorization may be 
stipulated as to granting individual authority to certain officers and joint authority 
to others, or that one of the signatories is  always a specific person. However, one 
person may have either individual or joint signature authority; which means, that 
Hungarian corporate law precludes a signature structure, where the officers would 
sign individually in day -to-day matters, but they wo uld sign jointly in a matter 
representing higher value.  
An authorized officer shall exercise power of representation in the same manner at 
all times, either individually or jointly.  
2.5.4 Pre-company (“Előtársaság”)  
As of the date when the articles of associa tion is executed in a public deed by a 
notary public or is countersigned by a lawyer or the legal counsel of the founder, 
until the registration of the company, the company may operate as the pre -
company of the business organization. The pre -company shall be considered to 
have legal capacity.  
A pre -company may commence its business operations after having submitted to 
the court of registration the company registration application.  
During the registration period, the pre -company status shall be indicated with the 
appendage “bejegyzés alatt”, or “b.a.” (meaning “registration in process”).  
The pre -company can not:  
(a) change the members of the pre -company, expect where provided in the 
Civil Code;  
(b) alter the articles of association except for the purpose of compliance 
with any request  made by the court of registry or the competent body of 
authorization ; 
(c) initiate legal proceedings for the exclusion of a member;  
(d) adopt any resolution on termination without succession, transformation 
into another company form, merger or demerger;  
(e) establish a business organization, or become a member thereof.  
   
19 2.6 Corporate Governance  
2.6.1 Supreme body  
The Civil Code provides that certain decisions fall under the exclusive 
competence of the supreme body (which consist of all members) of the business 
organization.  In addition to the statutory scope of powers the establishment 
document may assign further issues to the exclusive competence of the Supreme 
body, and, as a result, only the supreme body may decide on such issues.  
As a main rule, the supreme body shall adopt its decision if supported by the 
simple majority of the members, quotaholders or shareh olders. However, the 
articles of association or applicable law may require that certain decisions are 
rendered by a two -third, a three -quarter or a unilateral vote.  
The business organization’s supreme body is:  
(a) the meeting of members in case of general partnerships and limited 
partnerships;  
(b) the quotaholders’  meeting in case of limited liability companies;  
(c) the general meeting in case of public and private joint stock companies.  
In case of wholly -owned limited liability and joint stock companies, decisions 
falling within the competence of the supreme body shall be adopted by the sole 
quotaholder/shareholder, who shall notify the executive officers of such decision 
in writing. Such  decisions shall become effective when they are communicated to 
management.  
All members, quotaholders and shareholders of the business organization and - 
without voting rights - any person invited according to law  or the articles of 
association (e.g. man agement, supervisory board members) has the right to attend 
the meeting of the supreme body of the business organization. All members, 
quotaholders or shareholders of the business organization have the right to 
participate in the activities of the supreme body.  
2.6.2 Executive Officers  
The executive officer of a business organization is entitled to make all decisions 
that are related to the management and operation of the business organization and 
which do not fall under the exclusive competence of the supreme body.  
Duties of the management of the various types of business organizations are 
performed by:  
(a) members entitled to perform the management as managing directors, in 
case of general partnership and limited partnership;  
(b) one or more managing directors in case of limited liability companies;  
(c) board of directors in case of joint stock companies.  
20 The articles of association of a private joint stock company may confer powers of 
the board of directors onto one single executive officer (CEO). The articles of 
association of public joint stock companies may also contain provisions to confer 
management and supervisory functions upon the board of directors; in such case, 
the public joint stock company shall have no supervisory board (i.e. one-tier 
system) . 
The board of directors of a private joint stock company shall consist of at least 
three persons. The board of directors exercises its rights and performs its 
obligations as an independent body.  
In case the supervisory functions are conferred upon it, the boar d of directors of a 
public joint stock company shall consist of at least five natural persons. In this 
case, the majority of the members of the board of directors shall be independent 
persons, as defined by the Civil Code.  
Executives may be appointed eith er for an indefinite term or for a fixed term. In 
case the members have not stipulated the term of the executive officers ’ 
appointment, they shall be considered to have been appointed for a fixed term of 
five years, except if the business organization is e stablished for a shorter period.  
The mandate of an executive officer shall take effect from by his/her accepteance 
of such designation. Executive officers may be re -elected and may be removed by 
the supreme body of the business organization any time, with out providing a 
justification for the removal.  
The following persons can not be appointed as executive officers:  
 a person who has been convicted of a crime and has been sentenced to 
imprisonment  by final and binding court judgment, until relieved from 
the detrimental legal consequences related to his criminal record;  
 a person who has been banned by a final and binding court judgment 
from becoming an executive officer, under the term of such ban;  
 a person who has been banned by a final and binding court judgment 
from the profession of a business activity that the business organization 
is performing, under the term of such ban;  
 a person who was an executive officer or a member with unlimited 
liability or, in cases of business associations operating with the limited -
liability of the members, a member with majority control in a business 
organisation which was cancelled from the trade registry as a result of a 
forced cancellation proceeding, for a pe riod of five years after said 
cancellation. For this rule to apply, the individual must have held the 
relevant position on the date of or during the calendar year in which the 
forced cancellation proceeding occurred or in the one year prior to the 
forced c ancellation proceeding;  
 
   
21  a person who was found liable by a final and binding court decision for 
the outstanding claims incurred in a liquidation process or a forced 
cancellation proceeding if said person has not satisfied the payment 
obligation required of him/her pursuant to said judgment.  
 a person who, as the member of the business organization, failed to 
satisfy his/her unlimited liability to pay the debt of said business 
organization ; 
 a person on whom the court of registration imposed a fine, but failed to 
comply with said payment obligation.  
The following prohibitions on conflict of interest also apply to executive officers:  
 The executive may not acquire any quota or share - other than shares in 
a public joint stock company - in any ot her company whose main 
business activity is the same as the main business activity of that 
company at which he/she serves as executive. Furthermore, the 
executive may not accept any other executive officer position in a 
company, whose main business activit y is the same as the main business 
activity of that company at which he/she serves as executive.  
 The executive and his/her relatives may not conclude any contracts in 
his/her own name and interest the subject matter of which falls in the 
scope of the main  business activity of the company, unless the 
establishment document of the company permits such transactions.  
 The executive and his/her relatives may not be appointed to be the 
member of the supervisory board (if any) of that company at which the 
relevan t individual serves as executive.  
Executives may exercise their rights and perform their duties either on the basis of 
the provisions of the Civil Code regulating contracts for services or employment 
law provisions.  
A legal person may also be appointed as executive officer for any type of business 
organization. In this case the appointed legal person shall designate a natural 
person to discharge the functions of the executive officer in the name and on 
behalf of the appointed legal person. The rules pert aining to executive officers 
shall apply to the designated person as well.  
2.6.3 Supervisory Board  
In order to supervise the management of the business organization, the members  
may establish a supervisory board.  
The establishment of a supervisory board is mandatory:  
(a) for public joint stock companies, except for any company that is 
controlled by the one -tier system  (i.e. where the board of directors carry 
out the functions of the supervisory board as well) ; 
 
22 (b) if the annual average number of full -time employees employed by the 
business organization exceeds 200, and the works council did not 
relinquish employee participation in the supervisory board (in this case, 
the employees are entitled to delegate 1/3 of the members of the 
supervisory board);  
(c) irrespective of the form and operational structure of the company, where 
required by law.  
2.6.4 Auditor  
The auditor of the business organization shall be responsible for carrying out the 
audit of accounting documents as specified in the Accounting Act. Thus the 
auditor must determine whether the annual report that the business organization 
has prepared for the prior financial year, as required by the Accounting Act, is in 
conformity with the applicable legal requirements, and whether it provides a fair 
and true v iew of the company’s assets and liabilities, financial position, profit and 
loss. 
The business organization is obliged to nominate a statutory auditor, if it is 
required by the Accounting Act, by other laws or by the articles of association of 
the company . 
In addition, as a general rule, all joint stock companies shall nominate an auditor; 
however, the private joint stock companies’ articles of association may contain 
provisions contrary to the above provided that such provision would not breach 
the Accou nting Act or other laws.  
2.7 Establishment, Registration  
2.7.1 Establishment  
A business organization is established by (i) concluding an articles of association1; 
and (ii) registration with the court of registration.  
The articles of association shall be signed by all founders and shall be prepared 
either as a public deed prepared by a notary public or as a private document 
countersigned by a lawyer or the legal counsel of the founder.  
The content of the articles of association is primarily determined by the Civil 
Code; however, the members may freely include in the articles of association any 
additional provisions which do not conflict with the mandatory and binding 
regulations of the Civil Code or other laws.  
In general, the articles of association shall co ntain:  
(a) the corporate name and registered office of the business organization;  
 
                                                 
1 Articles of association has a different name depending on the company form; it is called as “deed of 
foundation” in case of public and private joint stock companies and wholly -owned companies and 
“articles of association” in case of multi -owned limited liability companies.  
23 (b) members of the business organization, indicating at least, in case of 
natural persons, their name  and address, and, in case of legal persons, 
their corporate name and registe red office;  
(c) the business organization’s main business activity or business purpose;  
(d) the financial contributions prescribed, the value of such contributions, as 
well as how and when such contributions are to be provided to the 
company ; 
(e) at least the name and address (registered office) of the first executive 
officers appointed by the members;  
(f) any other information required by the Civil Code for the various forms 
of business organizations.  
2.7.2 Registration mechanisms  
Business organizations shall be considered to be established at the time of their 
registration at the trade registry, effective as of the date of such registration.  
The registration application shall be filed with the court of registration within 30 
days from the date of the signing of the articles of association. However, in case 
an official authorization is required to perform the business activities, the deadline 
for the submission of the registration application shall be 15 days from obtaining 
the official authorization.  
Currently, two registration mechanisms are available:  
(a) general registration process or  
(b) simplified registration process.  
The length of the registration process depends on which mechanism is chosen to 
register the company. If a general registration process is chosen, the registration 
can occur within 15 working days. If the simplified registration process is used, 
the competent court of registration shall adopt a decision related to the application 
for registration within one hour after the tax number is establ ished for the 
concerned company. In each case, the days are counted from  the submission of all 
required documents, assuming the trade registry judge has no questions about 
those documents and does not require any additional documents.  
 
The simplified registration process leads to quicker registration but has potential 
disadvantages. To be able to proceed with the simplified process, the so called 
Template Establishment Document must be used as the articles of association of 
the company. The provisions of the Template Establishment Document are set out 
by the law, and those may not be changed in any way. Pursuant to this rule, a 
company, which is registered through such process, must be established with  a 
financial year which corresponds to the calendar  year and must use Hungarian 
Forint as its accounting currency.  
  
24  
2.8 Investments to Hungary in other structures  
2.8.1 Joint venture  
The old Companies Act abolished the company form “joint venture” (in 
Hungarian: közös vállalat), as a result of which  companies can not choose joint 
venture as the form of their business activities as of 1 July 2006.  
However, the above rules on the abolition of the joint venture as a company form 
do not prevent investors to create a joint venture together with a Hungari an entity 
in a company form specified by the currently effective Civil Code, for the purpose 
of cooperating through a specific project or for a continuing business relationship.  
2.8.2 Venture  Capital  
Venture capital is a type of private equity capital typically provided to early -stage, 
high-potential growth companies in the interest of generating a return through an 
eventual realization event. Venture capital is most attractive to new companies 
with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public 
markets and are too immature to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering. In 
exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller 
and less mature companies, venture capitalists usually get significa nt control over 
company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the company’s 
ownership (and consequently value).  
  
25 3. REAL PROPERTY  
3.1 Registration of  Real Properties  
In Hungary, all important information in relation to real properties is recorded in 
a public land registry system. Each real property has a land registry sheet  that 
describes the area and  the description of the real property and also indicates  the 
owner an d information with respect to mortgages, easements and  land use 
rights  encumbering the  real property.  However, the land registry does not include 
information on lease agreements.  The data registered on the land registry sheet are 
public information.  
Trans fer of  a real property requires a written  real property sale and purchase 
agreement, which must be  prepared and countersigned by a  Hungarian attorney at 
law and which has to be  filed with  the competent land registry office within 30 
days of its execution.  
3.2 Acquisition of Real Property  
3.2.1  Acquisition  
As a general rule, companies registered in Hungary (irrespective of the nationality 
of their owners, if Hungarian or foreign) may acquire real property For the general 
rules and restrictions, regarding the acquisition of agricultural land see Section 
3.2.2 and regarding the acquisition of non -agricultural  land (including developed 
and undeveloped land),   see Section 3.2 .3 below.  
Real property acquisitions may be completed through an asset deal or a share deal. 
In case of an asset deal, the real property is  purchased directly; while under a share 
deal an ownership interest is acquired in a company owning the target real 
property. Both types of acquisitions require a title due diligence on the target 
property. In addition, a legal due diligence on the target company is also required 
under a share deal transaction.  
Currently, both share deals and asset deals are subject to (i) 4 per cent transfer tax 
payable on the portion of the gross value (including VAT) of the target real 
property up to HUF  1 billion, and (ii) 2 per cent transfer tax payable on the portion 
of the gross value (including VAT) of the target real property  above HUF 1 
billion,  with a maximum amount of HUF 200 million per property . Share d eal 
transactions are VAT exempt.  
  
26  
3.2.2 Agricultural land and related restrictions  
Regarding agricultural land and forest properties, (1) the reclassification of the 
land and (2) the approval of a new zoning plan are required to ensure that a 
development can be implemented  on the real propert y. 
(1) The reclassification is subject to (i) the permit of the land registry office, (ii) 
the payment of the land contribution fee, (iii) a binding conceptual building permit 
for the development to be issued by the notary  of the local municipality, and (iv) 
the approval of the owner; (2) while the approval of the zoning plan is within the 
competence of the local municipality’s general assembly.  
The zoning plan proceeding usually takes 6 -8 months and the building permit 
proceeding usually takes an additional 3 -5 months. However, in case of a real 
property development, any interested party may appeal against the permits and the 
zoning plans, which may cause a delay in the commencement and the completion 
of the construction w ork. 
As to the acquisition of agricultural land, under Hungarian law, companies are not 
entitled to acquire agricultural lands (including forests) and to be granted an 
option right over agricultural land currently. Therefore, a company may only 
conclude a  preliminary sale and purchase agreement for any agricultural land with 
its owner. A preliminary sale and purchase agreement includes  obligation for the 
contracting parties to enter into the final sale and purchase agreement; however, 
there are certain ex it possibilities for both parties, regulated by Hungarian law, to 
terminate the preliminary agreement.  
After the zoning plans are approved, a binding conceptual building permit is 
issued and the reclassification of the agricultural land is completed, a final sale 
and purchase agreement may be concluded between the company and the owner 
on the acquisition of the reclassified development area.  
According to the provisions of the new act on agricultural land, effective as of 
May 2014, citizens of the European Union will be able to acquire agricultural land 
with the same conditions as Hungarian citizens . However, the  conditions prefer 
those citizens who have a Hungarian residence and who carry out their agricultural 
activity in Hungary. The main conditi ons are the following: (i) the citizen must 
have been living in Hungary at least for three years; (ii) the citizen must have been 
carrying out agricultural activity at least for three years; and (iii) the citizen must 
want to settle down in Hungary. The  legal persons of the European Union and 
citizens outside the European Union will still not be able to acquire agricultural 
land.  
  
27 3.2.3 Non-agricultural lands  
Regarding non -agricultural land (including developed and undeveloped land),  the 
ability of a fo reign company or person to (in this Section 3.2.3 “foreign” means 
outside the European Union) acquire a non -agricultural land is contingent on the 
decision of the relevant government office. Also, depending on its classification, a 
real property may be sub ject to certain limitations, such as pre -emption rights and 
mandatory tender proceedings regulated by the local municipality.  
With regard to these types of real properties, the modification of the existing 
zoning plans  and a plot formation may  be also required.  
As a general rule in case of transactions concerning buildings, the seller shall 
provide the purchaser with an energy certificate as a condition of the execution of 
the sale and purchase agreement. Pursuant to t he provisions of the new Civil 
Code, effective as of 15 March 2014, the owner of a property may request that the 
land and the building on it be registered as separate real properties in the land 
registry system.  
3.2.4  Related licensing matters  
As to lice nsing, the construction work may only be commenced following the 
receipt of a binding and final building permit. The building permit is to be issued 
by the notary of the local municipality.  
In respect of agricultural land, the approval of the zoning plans is a condition 
precedent to the issuance of the building permit.  
As to the road infrastructure, based on the practice of the road authorities and the 
market practice, there is often an obl igation to construct the necessary private and 
public roads at the cost of the development. The construction of the roads is 
subject to a separate road permit which is to be issued by the road authority.  
After the construction work has been completed, an occupancy permit (and a road 
occupancy permit in case of road constructions) must be applied for. The 
development may only be utilized based on and subsequent to the receipt of a 
binding occupancy permit.  
Subject to the site condition of the target real p roperty, archaeological excavation 
or environmental decontamination may also be required, which may cause a delay 
in the construction and may also result in extra costs.  In addition, as a condition 
precedent to the arch eological excavation, the target real  estate may be subject to 
ammunition discharge and examination, based on its conditions.  
 
 
28 In case of a construction contract entered into with a general contractor for a total 
value of more th an EUR 5,186,0002 (data determined every year by the European 
Union) a so called project fund manager (a commercial bank or the state treasury) 
shall be appointed, who controls and manages the funds covering the construction 
costs and ensures that subcontractors are duly p aid. 
3.2.5  Temporary restriction on commercial developments  
As a temporary restriction, new commercial buildings larger than 300 square 
meters may not be constructed, and existing commercial buildings may not be 
enlarged to exceed the above size limit or existing (commercial) buildings may not 
be transformed to commercial buildings (if requiring any permit) without the 
approval of the minister in charge of trade and commerce. Such restriction is likely 
to no longer apply after 31 December 2014. Also, each commercial building 
selling daily consumer goods shall ensure a defined number of parking spaces; the 
local government may not deviate from this rule in case of those commercial 
building selling daily consumer goods that are larger than 300 square meters.

29 4. ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY  
4.1 Overview  
Hungary offers great opportunities for investors in the fields of energy and 
environment.  
Most of the power plants in Hungary are old and operate with relatively low 
efficiency and high pollution. Electricity is mostly generated by nuclear and fossil 
material -powered plants; within the latter, especially the ratio of gas -based power 
plants is relatively high. Hungary’s obligations to reduce emission and to increase 
energy generated by ren ewable sources necessitates a change in Hungary’s energy 
strategy and open new perspectives for investors with renewable energy projects.  
Consequently, there is a need to build new capacities, and in this regard, the 
increased utilization of renewable ene rgy should be highly evaluated.  
In accordance with Directive 2009/28/EC on promotion of the use of energy from 
renewable sources, Hungary undertook to increase the share of energy produced 
from renewable energy sources to 14.65% by 2020.  
Investors can take advantage of benefits through participating in various 
mechanisms, such as e.g. JI projects or Green Investment Schemes which might 
result in receiving transfer emission reduction units and subsidies by the state.  
4.2 Environmental Regu lation  
Act LIII of 1995 on the General Rules of Environmental Protection (“EPA ”) 
establishes a general framework for environmental law and sets out the principles. 
Based on the EPA’s principles and general provisions, several other acts, decrees 
and regul ations contain detailed rules on the environment’s various elements 
(water, soil and air), noise and vibration, radiation, waste (hazardous waste) and 
the protection of nature. The detailed sectorial rules are usually in line with the 
EU’s environmental di rectives.  
General rules apply to the above -mentioned different activities affecting or 
possibly affecting the environment in respect of environmental planning, liability 
and permits.  
The laws define those activities for which some form of permit is required. 
Activities using or threatening the environment may be conducted after obtaining 
an authorization or permit (collectively: “permits”). The procedures for obtaining 
such permit vary depending on what permit is required for the activity, according 
to the level of impact on the environment and, in certain cases, to the sectors 
affected by the given activity. The major types of permits are:  
 
  
30  environmental permit;  
 integrated pollution prevention and control (“IPPC”) permit;  
 site permit;  
 other, sector -specific operating permits.  
The operator must obtain such permit usually from the competent regional 
environmental agency (or from the local municipality) or, in some cases, must 
make a notification to the agency. The authority may impose obligatio ns and/or 
conditions when issuing a permit. The rules usually contain limit values for 
emission. Some laws - and usually the permits - set out regular reporting 
obligations as to the emitted pollutants/components.  
Other pieces of legislation constitute a shift from the above -mentioned “command 
& control” approach to economic and other incentives: there are several types of 
fees payable for emission/ the use of natural resources, which aim at the reduction 
of the impact on the environment.  
In case of damage to the environment or other type of breach (e.g. the failure to 
timely make the reporting obligations) the liability provisions must be applied. 
The liability principles are set out in the EPA and its implementing legislation 
while other pieces of l egislation contain environmentally relevant provisions 
which are/can be relevant for environmental purposes. Environmental legal 
obligations and standards are generally part of administrative law. Thus, 
administrative environmental liability can be conside red the most important area 
of environmental liability. The EPA sets out the legal framework for 
administrative liability and, further, refers to the specific environmental liability 
provisions of the Civil Code, the Criminal Code and the Administrative Of fences 
Act, with some differences.  
Generally, the EPA imposes an obligation to discontinue an activity threatening or 
polluting the environment, and to rectify any pollution or damage caused to the 
environment as a result of such activity. Courts and auth orities may also restrict, 
suspend or prohibit the pursuit of environmentally hazardous activities. Under 
certain circumstances, users may be required to provide security for possible 
environmental damage, or to procure liability insurance.  
Those who exce ed permitted contamination or emission limit values imposed by 
the relevant regulations, or act in violation of other requirements specified in 
environmental laws, must pay environmental protection fines in proportion to the 
amount, gravity and frequency o f the pollution, the environmental damage caused 
or the breach of the applicable obligation. Different detailed rules concerning 
environment fines are specified in the applicable sectoral decrees.  
 
  
31 5. TAXATION  
The below is a general summary of the taxation rules in Hungary , where  taxation 
rules change frequently, but the main concept of taxation does not change and the 
tax system is stable.  
5.1 Corporate Taxation  
5.1.1  Corporate Income Tax  
As of 1 January 2011, the corporate income tax rate is 10% up to the first HUF 
500 million of the annual positive tax base; above HUF 500 million, the applicable 
tax rate is 19%.  The tax base is the company’s pre -tax profit amended by tax base  
increasing and tax base reducing facto rs (carry forward losses, depreciation, etc).  
5.1.2  No Withholding Tax  
In Hungary, there is no withholding tax on dividend, royalty  and interest payments 
made between corporate entities from a Hungarian source.  
5.2 Local Business Tax  
Local municipalities are entitled to levy up to 2 per cent local business tax on the 
following tax base: net sales revenue less  the cost of goods sold and value of 
mediated services, the cost of sub -contractors, the cost of materials and the R&D 
costs.  
Cost of goods sold and value of mediated services is gradually deductible. Up to 
net sales of HUF 500 million, the full amount  is deductible; if the net sales exceed 
that amount, a lower percentage (70 -85% depending on the net sales) of the cost 
of goods sold and value of mediated services is the deductible. Other costs 
described above are fully deductible, irrespective of the net sales.  
The Municipality of Budapest applies the maximum 2 per cent rate.  
5.3 Value Added Tax  
Currently, there are three VAT rates applied in Hungary. The standard VAT rate 
of 27 per cent applies to most products and services; the reduced VAT rate of 18 
per cent applies to basic alimentary (such as milk, dairy products and products 
made from grain or flour), district -heating and certain entertainment services; the 
super reduced of 5 per cent applies to basic pharmaceuticals and books. As of 1 
January 2016 the reduced 5 per cent rate also applies to new residential properties, 
which do not exceed 150  sqm and are placed in a building with several residential 
properties; and also to new single -unit residential properties, which do not exceed 
300 sqm.  
 
 
 
  
32 5.4 Public Health Product Tax  
A public health product tax is levied on pre -packaged food products  containing 
higher quantity of sugar, salt or caffeine than specified in the relevant act. The tax 
rate is based on the quantity of sugar, salt or caffeine in the product ( e.g.  in case 
of soft drinks HUF 7/liter, if the added sugar content exceeding the a mount 8 
grams of sugar/100 milliliters).  
5.5 Excise duty  
Excise duty is levied e.g. on tobacco, alcoholic drinks and mineral oils.  
5.6 Transfer Tax  
The transfer of real property and rights related to real property is subject to 
transfer tax on the basis of the market value of the real estate. The transfer tax is 
payable by the transferee. The general rate of transfer tax for real estates is 4 per 
cent (up to a market value of HUF 1 billion) and 2 per cent (on the excess above 
this value), tax payable capped at HUF 200 million per  real estate . Special transfer 
tax rate applies if the real estate is acquired by a real estate agent or a financial 
leasing company or a real estate investment fund. The transfer of a company 
holding Hungarian real estate is also subject to transfer tax, at the above rates.  
The gift of movables, immovables and immaterial rights is subject to gift duty. 
Gift duty has a general rate of 18%. The gift duty of obtaining rights (including 
ownership) relative to a residential property is 9%.  Gifts among the closest 
relatives are exempted from gift duty.  
5.7 Bank tax and surtax payable by financial institutions  
Hungary introduced a bank tax on credit institutions, insurance companies, 
financial enterprises, investment enterprises, stock exchanges, commodity traders, 
hedge fund managers and investment fund managers, at various rates for the 
different categories of  financial institutions. For example, for investment 
enterprises, the tax base is the difference between the income from and the 
expenses of investment services, as recorded in the 2009 financials of the 
investment enterprise; the tax rate is 5.6%. In case  of credit institution, the tax rate 
is 0.15% up to tax base of HUF 50 billion, above that amount the applicable tax 
rate in 2016 is 0 .24%.  The tax rate is expected to change in the subsequent tax 
years.  
 In addition to bank tax, credit institutions are o bliged to pay a profit -based surtax 
as well. The rate of this “credit institutions surtax” is 30% but maximum the 
amount of bank tax and is deductible from the amount of payable bank tax.  
 
33 5.8. Transaction duty  
As of January 1, 2013 so -called transaction  duty was introduced.  As of 1 August 
2013, the credit institutions is subject to a 0.3 percent financial transaction duty in 
relation to each bank transactions they perform; such as bank transfers, 
collections, cash -payments to and from payment accounts an d cash wire transfers. 
However, the transaction duty is capped at HUF 6000 per trans action . Transaction 
duty in relation with cash -payments from payment accounts is 0.6 percent, without 
being capped.

34 6. INCENTIVES TO INVEST ORS IN HUNGARY  
6.1 Overview  
Creating new jobs, developing Hungarian businesses to reach new markets, 
and investment promotion for foreign investors.  
These are the aims of Hungary.  
 
Cost efficiency, high human capital productivity and business -friendly 
environment.  
 
These phrases also mean Hungary. The Hungarian Government is committed to 
ease doing business, to increase the competitiveness of both SMEs and large 
enterprises in Hungary. The focus is on high value added activities, like shared 
service centers, research and developme nt, high value added production.  
 
What can Hungary offer you?  
 
One of Hungary’s competitive advantages over other countries in the region is the 
Government’s strong commitment to streamlining business processes and 
increasing the competitiveness of SMEs  and large firms in Hungary. To help 
achieve this, we offer wide -ranging incentives – both refundable and non -
refundable – to facilitate foreign direct investments and reinvestments by local 
enterprises. The main types of incentives are cash subsidies (eit her from the 
Hungarian Government or from EU Funds), tax incentives, low -interest loans, and 
free or reduced price lands.  
 
 
The legal basis for all investment subsidies within Hungary is provided by 
common legal framework of the European Union. Following maximum regional 
subsidy intensity ratios have been set by the European Commission:  
 
The maximum aid intensity is 50% in Northern Hungary, Northern Great Plain, 
Southern Great Plain and Southern Transdanubia; 25% in Western Transdanubia ; 
35% in the Central Transdanubia region; and 0%, 20% or 35% in the Central 
Hungarian region. Parts of Central Hungary are ineligible to receive any funding 
because they are much closer to the EU average in development terms.

Maximum regional intensity  
 
 
 
 
 
  

36  
 
 
 
For investments not exceeding EUR 50M  the maximum intensity ratio is increased 
by 10 percentage points for medium -sized and by 20 percentage points for small 
enterprises. For criteria determining SME categories see table below:  
 
Size  Headcount  Turnover  OR  Balance Sheet  
Small  < 50  <= EUR 10 M  OR  <= EUR 10 M  
Medium  < 250  <= EUR 50 M  OR  <= EUR 43 M  
Large  >= 250  > EUR 50 M  OR  > EUR 43 M  
 
Subsidy for large investment projects is also subject to an adjusted regional aid 
ceiling, on the basis of the following scale:  
 
Eligible expenditure  Adjusted aid ceiling  
Up to EUR 50M  100 % of regional ceiling  
For part between EUR 50 -100M  50 % of regional ceiling  
For part exceeding EUR 100M  34 % of regional ceiling  
 
 
 
 

37  
TAX ALLOWANCES  
 
There is a wide range of tax allowances for new investments and R&D. Hungary provides 
tax exemption on holding structures, capital gains on shares and intellectual property under 
certain conditions are tax free, and a 50% tax allowance is applicable on royalty incomes. 
There is no wit hholding tax on dividends, interest and royalty paid by a Hungarian company 
to a foreign company. Hungary has a wide international treaty network with more than 80 
double tax treaties.

38 SUBSIDY BASED ON INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENT DECISION  
 
The main types of cash incentives related to investments are focused on asset investment 
(e.g. purchasing assets, construction work, etc.), creating new jobs, and training employees. 
A VIP cash subsidy ( subsidy based on individual government decision) may be granted 
under current legislation based on Government Decree No. 210/2014. (VIII.27.) on the 
utilisation of investment incentive targeted appropriations.  
 
The Hungarian Government makes a VIP subsidy opportunity available for investments 
greater than € 5, 10 or 20 million t hat create a certain number of new jobs, depending on the 
purpose and location of the investment. The conditions of the VIP subsidy are determined in 
a negotiation procedure between the investor and the Hungarian authorities. Subsidy 
applications can be submitted to HIPA, in English or in Hungarian.  
The main areas that attract support are asset investment (greenfield, brownfield or capacity 
extension) and investments aimed at job cre ation.

building rental fee (during the implementation   period), infrastructural costs, thepurchase of 
new equipment and machines, intangible assets, etc. The investment per iod is determined by

SUBSIDIES FROM EU FUNDS  
 
A wide range of tender calls are available from EU Funds for which investments of less than 
€ 10 million  can also qualify. As a member of the European Union Hungary has access to 
EU funds for a number of development goals, such as asset acquisition,  infrastructural 
development, new construction, renovation, service development, job creation and financing 
of human resources costs. The conditions for applying, the timing, and the total amount of 
the subsidy available vary from tender to tender. The first relevant tenders for the current 
seven financial years in the forms of both refundable and non -refundable in centives were 
announced in the autumn of 2014.  
 
 
  
42 7. IMMIGRATION  
Hungary joined the European Union in May 2004; however, it became part of the 
Schengen area only at the end of 2007.  
The Schengen Agreement was incorporated into European law by the Amsterdam 
Treaty and has been further developed since then. The Schengen provisions are 
currently applied by twenty -two EU Member States and four other European 
countries, and provide for the  removal of systematic border controls between the 
participating countries3, establishment of common control at the borders of the 
Schengen area, application of a common visa policy and all measures related to 
these matters.  
Pursuant to the Schengen provi sions, nationals of the Schengen Member States are 
no longer required to show their passports when crossing borders of the Schengen 
Member States. Accordingly, Hungarian citizens are free to enter other Schengen 
Member States without a  passport. However, different rules apply to nationals of 
third countries.  
7.1 Applicable legislation for immigration requirements of third country 
 nationals  
Regulation No 810/2009/EC on the European Parliament and of the Council (the 
“Visa Code”) regulation , as well as EC  Regulation No 562/2006 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council on the rules governing the movement of persons 
across borders (“Schengen Borders Code”) establishes the procedures and 
conditions for issuing visas for short stays in and transit through  the territories of 
Member States of the European Union, and also, it lists the third countries whose 
nationals are required to hold an airport transit visa when passing through the 
international transit areas of Member States’ airports and establishes the  
procedures and conditions for issuing such visas.  
 
Act II of 2007 on the Admission and Rights of Residence of Third -Country 
Nationals (“Third -Country Nationals Act”) provides the relevant rules concerning 
the entry and residence of third -country national s in Hungary. The Third -Country 
Nationals Act provides different rules and requirements applicable on residency of 
third -country nationals in Hungary for a period not exceeding 90 days within any 
180-day period and for a period exceeding 90 days within any  180-day period.

allowing third country national managers, sp ecialists or tra inee employees  
transferred  to Europe to reside and work at various  entities of the same group of 
company within various Member States of the European Union , is before 
Parliament and is expected to be adopted by September 2016.

requires a work permit, the validity period of the residence  permit must be 
identical to the validity period of the work permit.  
In addition, under specific circumstances, a residence permit may be issued for the 
purpose  of family reunification, performing work, studying, scientific research, 
etc. 
Third country nationals residing in Hungary for more than 90 days in any 180 -day 
period for the purpose of performing work with a Hungarian employer must obtain 
a so-called joint work and residency permit, in a so -called joint procedure.   
 
 
  
45 Settlement Permit  
The app licable law specifies 3 (three) types of settlement permit: (i) an interim 
settlement  permit ; (ii) a national settlement permit , and (iii) an EC settlement 
permit . However, the Third -Country Nationals Act also acknowledges the 
settlement permit  which was i ssued before the Third -Country Nationals Act came 
into force.  
A third -country national intending to settle down in Hungary may obtain (i) an 
interim settlement permit, (ii) a national settlement permit or (iii) an EC settlement

Hungarian company operating with foreign participation.  
 
  
47 8. EMPLOYMENT  
As a result of Hungary’s accession to the EU in 2004, Hungarian  labour law has 
now been almost fully harmonized with the applicable EU laws.  
8.1 Sources of Hungarian Labour Law  
The primary source of Hungarian labour law is Act I of 2012 on the Labour Code 
(the “Labour Code”), which entered into force on 1 July 2012, after Act XXII of 
1992 (the “old Labour Code”) was repealed. In addition to the Labour Code, 
various other Hungarian legislations relating to labour matters, health and safety, 
social benefits and immigration issues can also govern a particular employment 
relationship.  
There are three levels of Hungarian labour law based on which an employment  
relationship can be governed. These are:  
(i) the Labour Code and other labour legislation;  
(ii) collective bargaining agreement;  
(iii) the employment contract concluded between the individual employee 
and the employer.  
8.2 Concept of unilateral cogency  
One of the main concepts of the Labour Code, which significantly protects the 
employees’ rights, is known as the “unilateral cogency” employment rule. This 
rule of law provides that the parties to an employment contract may only differ 
from the statutory p rovisions of the Labour Code relating to certain matters and 
only if such terms are more favorable for the employee than the statutory 
provisions. As of 1 July 2012, various dispositive rules have been introduced to 
the Labour Code. As a result, contractin g parties to an employment contract are 
entitled to deviate from the statutory provisions of the Labour Code to a much 
larger extent than they have been in the past, and the provisions relating to the 
collective bargaining agreement also provide a wide dis cretion to deviate from 
statutory minimum rules of the Labour Code.  
8.3 Terms of employment  
The Labour Code requires employment relationships to be established in writing, 
which is to be arranged for by the employer. An employment contract not 
concluded in writing can be cited as invalid by the employee within a period of 
thirty days from the commencement of work. The employment contract may not 
be contrary to the collective bargaining agreement, unless it stipulates more 
favorable terms for the employee.  
The name and other important employment -related information of the parties, the 
basic salary of the employee, the job profile of the employee and the employee’s 
place of work must always be defined in the employment contract. The place of 
work can be a per manent location or  a wider geographic area as specified in the 
employment contract.  
 
48 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in addition to the minimum conditions set out 
above, it is always advisable to define the most important conditions of the 
employment relationship in the employment contract. If those are not regulated in 
the employment contract, the employer must, upon concluding the employment 
contract, inform the employee of certain important information in relation to  
working conditions and must con firm those in writing within 15 days.  
The employment relationship can be established for a definite or for an indefinite 
period of time. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the employment 
relationship is established for an indefinite period of time . A defninte term 
employment relationship can be maximum 5 years  (except for the executive 
employees), including the term of a definite term relationship and that of a new 
definite term employment relationship created within six months of the 
termination of t he previous definite term employment relationship. Where an 
employment for a definite period is renewed or extended between the same parties 
without any rightful interest attached to the part of the employer and the 
conclusion of the contract is aimed at c ompromising the rightful interests of the 
employee, the employment relationship shall be deemed to have been established 
for an indefinite period of time.  
Unless otherwise provided in the employment contract, the employment is 
established on a full -time basis.  
8.4 Probationary period  
A probationary period can be stipulated in the employment contract. The term of 
the probationary period shall be a maximum of 3 months. Probationary period can 
be extended one time, provided however that together with the e xtension it does 
not exceed 3 months. The collective bargaining agreement may stipulate a 
maximum of 6 months probationary period. The contracting parties can not 
deviate from the above mentioned rules relating to probationary period . During the 
probationa ry period of employment, the employment relationship can be 
terminated by either party with immediate effect and without justification.  
8.5 Working conditions  
8.5.1  Basic Salary  
Unless otherwise provided by law, the basic salary must be established and paid in 
Hungarian Forints. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or stipulated in the 
labour law regulations, the salary must be paid at the latest by the tenth day of the 
month following  the relevant month.  
8.5.2  Fixed salary vs. Performance -related salary  
The employee may receive a fixed salary, which is not related either to his/her or 
the company’s performance; however, his/her salary may also be linked to his/her 
performance.  If the achievement of the performance requirement does not depend 
solely on the employee, a minimum salary must be guaranteed.  
 
 
49 2.8.3 Bonus  
Apart from the above described salary structure, the employer may grant a bonus 
to an employee, in addition to the employee’s salary. The granting of a bonus is 
normally in the employer’s sole discretion and may not be claimed by the 
employee. However, if the bonus is promised in advance to an employee upon 
completing a specific task, such bonus can be claimed by the e mployee.  
2.9 Working Hours and Overtime  
2.9.1 General  
The general  statutory limitation relating to the work hours are 8 hours per work 
day. 
The working time, with extraordinary work ordered to be performed by the 
employee may be increased to the maximum of 12 hours per day and 48 hours a 
week; however, the law strictly defines when extraordinary work may be ordered, 
and the maximum amount thereof. 
2.9.2 Reference period scheduling system  
Working time can be defined in the so -called reference period scheduling system. 
If an employer adopts the so called reference period  scheduling system, the 
working time of the employee may exceed the general 8/40 hours limit, but it 
cannot exceed 12 hours per day, and the average of the reference period must 
correspond to the general 8/40 hours limit.  
2.9.3 Extraordinary Work  
In exceptional cases the employee may be obliged to perform extraordinary work. 
Work beyond the scheduled working hours, work performed on weekly days off 
and on public holidays, as well as stand -by at defined places for a specific period 
of time all qualify as extraordinary work.  
Employees may be required to perform extraordinary work only under justified 
and extraordinary circumstances. Extraordinary work on public holidays  can be 
ordered only if the employee can otherwise be required to work on such day; or in 
the interest of the  prevention or mitigation of any imminent danger of accident, 
natural disaster or serious damage or of any danger to life, health or physical 
integrity.  
Extraordinary work can not be ordered if it imposes any danger to the physical 
integrity or health of the employee, or if it constitutes any unreasonable hardship 
to the employee in respect of h is/her personal, family or other circumstances.  
An employee may be ordered to work not more than two hundred fifty hours of 
extraordinary work in any given calenda r year; or three hundred  hours if so 
stipulated by the collective bargaining agreement.  
 
  
50 Extraordinary work can not be required from  pregnant women from the date their 
pregnancy is diagnosed to the time when the child reaches the age of three; men 
caring  for their children as single parents up to the time when the child reaches the 
age of three; and employees who work under conditions harmful to health as 
defined by other legislation. For single parents, between the age three and four of 
the child, the employee's consent is required for extraordinary work.  
If extraordinary work is performed beyond regular working hours, the employee is 
entitled to time -off in lieu of the extra hours worked, or a supplement of 50% on 
his/her salary for the extra hou rs worked.  If the extraordinary work is performed 
on the employee’s weekly day off, the employee is entitled to 100% supplement 
on his/her salary for the extra hours worked, or a minimum supplement of 50% on 
his/her salary  and time -off in lieu of the extra  time worked.  
 
2.9.4 Rest Period  
Should the daily working time exceed six hours, the employee is entitled to at 
least a twenty -minute continuous break. In addition to this, the employee is 
entitled to at least twentyfive  minutes of continuous break after nine hours of 
work. The employees must be allowed at least eleven hours of rest between the 
end and commencement of daily work. Although the collective bargaining 
agreement and or employment agreement may deviate from the  above rule, 
nevertheless a minimum of eight hours of rest must still be provided to each 
employee between the end and commencement of daily work.  
2.9.5 Weekly Days off  
The employee is entitled to two days off weekly.  
Weekly days -off of employees employed und er irregular work  schedules (e.g., 
continuous operation in multiple shifts and seasonal work) can be scheduled 
irregularly; however, even in such case, one day -off must still be scheduled after 
six days worked on a weekly basis; of these days at least one day off in every 
month must fall on a Sunday.  
2.10 Annual Leave  
Annual leave consist of base vacation and additional vacation.  
An employee is entitled to 20 days base vacation days per year. The employee is 
entitled to additional vacation days after reaching  a particular age, as shown in the 
chart below:

Annual leave shall be scheduled by the employer; however, seven days of the total 
number of the annual leave shall be scheduled as requested by the employe e. 
Annual leave shall be allocated in the year in which it is due. Employers may 
allocate vacation time before the 31st of March of the year following the year in 
question if this option is stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement. If the 
employee’s illness or another unavoidable rest raint affects the employee, annual 
leaves shall be taken within 60 days following the cessation of such restraint. If 
the employment started on or after the 1st of October, the annual leave can be 
allocated until 31 March of the following year. Unless othe rwise stipulated in the 
employment contracts, annual leave must be provided to the employees in a 
manner that it exceeds at least 14 calendar days. Employer and employee can 
agree to allocate the additional vacation days due according to the employee’s age  
until the end of the following year in question.  
2.11 Sick Leave  
Employees shall be entitled to fifteen days of sick leave per calendar year from the 
employer, for the duration of time during which the employee is unable to work 
due to illness, not including  accidents at work and occupational diseases as 
specified by other laws. Employees are entitled to receive 70 per cent of the 
absentee pay for the duration of sick leave.  
For the period of sick leave exceeding fifteen days, employees are entitled to 
recei ve support from the social security authorities. The maximum period of sick 
leave is one year under the current social insurance system.  
The employee is required to submit a doctor’s certificate to verify the reason for 
his or her absence during his/her i llness.  
 
   
52 2.12 Other Work Time Allowances  
2.12.1  Maternity leave  
All pregnant employees are entitled to take up to 24 weeks maternity leave, of 
which two weeks must be taken.  Maternity leave should be taken  preferably  in 
such manner that 4 weeks fall before the expected date of the childbirth.  
The employee  is entitled to additional maternity leave without pay:  
(a) until the child reaches the age of three, in order to care for the child at 
home;  
(b) until the child rea ches the age of ten, during the period of eligibility for 
child -care allowance, provided that the employee cares for the child at 
home.  
 
2.12.2  Paternity Leave  
The father is entitled to take 5 days paternity leave within 2 months following the 
birth of the child.  
2.12.3  Long - term home care  
The employee may request the employer to permit unpaid leave for long - term 
nursing or home care of close relatives for the duration of care, if the employee 
personally provides such care and if the period of leave presumably will exceed 30 
days. The duration of long - term home care must reflect the duration of the home 
care and it may not exceed 2 years. Long -term home care shall be certified by a 
duly qualified medical practitioner of the person who requires the care.  
2.12.4  Additi onal leave in case of children  
Employees having children younger than 16 years of age are entitled to additional 
vacation days. In case of one child two days, in case of two children four days, 
and in case of three or more children seven additional vacati ons days must be 
allocated yearly to the employees.  
2.13 Public Holidays  
Public holidays are: 1 January, 15 March, Easter Monday, 1 May, Whit  Monday, 
20 August, 23 October, 1 November, 25 -26 December.  
2.14 Termination of the Employment  
Pursuant to the Labour  Code, an employment relationship may be terminated by: 
(i) notice; (ii) notice with immediate effect; or (iii) by mutual consent of the 
employer and employee.  
 
 
  
53 2.14.1  Termination of Employment by Notice  
(a) Indefinite term employment  
Both an employer  and an employee may terminate an employment relationship for 
an indefinite period by providing a notice to the other party.  
The notice of termination by an employer must contain the employer’s clear and 
justified reasons for termination, unless the employee is an executive of the 
employer as defined by the Labour Code (e.g. a managing director or a member of 
the Board of Direct ors). Termination notices, which fail to include justified 
reasons are unlawful.  
The reasons for the termination may only be in connection with: (i) the abilities of 
the employee; (ii) his/her behavior in relation to the employment; or (iii) the 
operation  of the employer.  
If the employee terminates an indefinite employment relationship by a notice, 
he/she is not required to justify such termination . 
In certain cases (e.g.: if the employee is pregnant), the Labour Code prohibits the 
employer from terminat ing the employment relationship simply by providing a 
notice of termination.  
(b) Definite term employment  
An employment relationship for a definite period of time can be terminated by the 
employer by way of a notice if (i ) the employer is undergoing a bankruptcy -or 
liquidation procedure; (ii) the reason of the termination is the abilities of the 
employee; or (iii) the employer cannot maintain the employment relationship for 
external reasons not attributable to the employer .  
Employees may also terminate a definite term employment relationship by 
providing a termination notice to the employer if there are such circumstances 
which make it impossible for the employee to maintain the employment 
relationship or which would  res ult in an improportionate burden on the employee.  
2.14.2  Termination of Employment by Notice with Immediate Effect  
Both an employer and or an employee may terminate an employment  relationship 
by providing a termination a notice with immediate effect if:  
(a) any important obligation stemming from the employment is materially 
and intentionally breached by the other party or if the breach is caused 
by the  gross negligence of either party; or  
(b) the other party acts in a way which precludes the possibility of 
maintaining the employment relationship.  
 
  
54  
 
The parties may neither extend nor limit the scope of the reasons which may serve 
as a basis for termination with immediate effect. However, the parties may give 
concrete examples in the employment contract which may lead to an termination 
with immediate effect within the scope defined above.  
A notice of termination must contain the terminating party’s clear and justified 
reasons for termination.  
The party terminating the employment relationship by a notice  with immediate 
effect must exercise this right within fifteen days of learning about the cause for 
such extraordinary termination. However, the terminating party may exercise the 
right of termination within a maximum period of one year from the date on wh ich 
the facts giving rise to the right to terminate actually arose. Further, if the reason 
for the termination with immediate effect is a crime committed by the other party, 
then the party terminating the employment may do so within the applicable 
statutor y limitation period.  
In addition to the above, either party may terminate the employment relationship 
by immediate effect during the probationary period, and reasoning is not required.  
Further, the employer (and only the employer) can terminate a definite term 
employment relationship if it pays to its employee an amount equal to one year’s 
absentee fee. If, however, the remaining period of employment is less than one 
year, an amount equal to the absentee fee for such remaining period must be paid.  
A notice with immediate effect immediately terminates the employment 
relationship.  
2.15 Definition of Executives under the Labour Code  
Different provisions of the Labour Code are applicable to the top management  as 
compared to the general employees of an employer.  
For the purposes of the Labour  Code, an executive is the head of an employer (i.e. 
the manager(s), in case of a limited liability company, and the members of the 
board of directors, in case of a company limited by shares) and his/her deputies.  
In addition, the employment contract may stipulate that employees with a salary of 
at least 7 times the minimum statutory salary performing important scope of duties 
and acting as key employees qualify as executives under the Labour Code . 
An executive is liable for all the damages arising from t he executive’s wilfully or 
negligent conduct.  
  
55  
2.16 Trade Unions  
2.16.1  Definition of Trade Unions  
The Labour Code defines a trade union as an employee organization whose 
primary  function is the promotion and protection of the employees’ interests as 
they relate to the employment relationship.  
2.16.2  The Role and Certain Rights of a Trade Union  
The Labour  Code permits employees to establish trade unions within the 
organization of the employer. A trade union may operate local organizations 
inside a company and may involve its mem bers in such operations.  
A trade union may inform its members of their rights and obligations concerning 
their material, social, cultural, living, and working  conditions and represent them 
against their employer and/or before state authorities in matters concerning labour 
relations and employment.  
A trade union may represent its me mbers, on the basis of a power of attorney , 
before a court of law or any other authority or organization in relation to matters 
relating to their living and working conditions.  
2.17 The Collective Bargaining Agreement  
A collective (bargaining) agreement between the employer(s) or an organization 
that represents the interest of the employer(s) and the trade union(s) regulates the 
rights and duties arising from the employment relationship, the manner of 
exercising and fulfilling the same, the procedural rul es related thereto, and the 
relationship between the parties thereto. The trade union whose candidates 
received at least 50% of the votes in the workers’ council election is deemed as 
the representative for such negotiations. If more than one workers’ coun cil is 
elected at an employer, the results of each election are combined to determine 
representation rights. A trade union whose membership includes at least two -
thirds of the employees of an employer in the same employment group is also 
deemed as a repres entative. If a trade union qualifying as a representative union 
requests the employer to enter into negotiations with that trade union concerning 
the collective bargaining agreement, the employer may not refuse to commence 
such negotiations.  
Each year an employer must propose to negotiate the regulations on the 
remuneration for work set out in the collective bargaining agreement with the 
representative trade union.  
Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the collective bargaining agreement may 
be terminat ed by either party by providing a notice three months in advance of the 
date of termination to the other party, but it may not be terminated during the first 
six months after the execution of the collective bargaining agreement.  
  
56 2.18 Workers’ Councils  
The Labour Code provides that a workers’ council must be elected at all 
employers or at all of the employer’s independent premises or sites where the 
number of employees exceeds 50.  
If the number of employees (in total or at any independent division of the 
employer) is less than 51 but exceeds 15, no workers’ council is required to be 
elected, but a workers’ representative must be elected by the employees. The 
Labour Code’s provisions regulating the rights and obligations of a workers’ 
council apply equally t o the workers’ representative.  
Workers’ council and the workers’ representative are elected for a five -year term.  
The employer must request, at least 15 days before making a decision, the opinion 
of the workers’ council relating to its contemplated measures affecting a larger 
group of employees, in particular plans for reorganization, transformation of the 
employer, c onversion of an organizational unit into an independent organization, 
modernization.  
In addition to this, the employer must at least every half year inform the works 
council relating to its economic situation, the change of the renumeration, the change 
of the work conditions and in the number of employees as well as of the position of 
the employees performing telework or being seconded to the employer.  
Further, a workers’ council may request information from an employer in relation to 
all issues and may request the employer to negotiate with the workers’ council  
relating to certain previously specified issues. The employer is not entitled to refuse 
this request from the workers’ council.  
The workers’ council and the employer may enter into a workers’ co uncil 
agreement, in which they may regulate all issues that can be regulated in a collective 
bargaining agreement, except for issues related to renumeration. No agreement with 
the workers’ council can be concluded if the employer is subject to a collective  
bargaining agreement or if there is a trade union at the employer who is entitled to 
enter into a collective bargaining agreement.  
2.19 European workers’ council  
Act XXI of 2003 on the establishment of European workers’ council and the 
procedures of consultation and information of employees regulates  the establishment 
and operation of European workers’ councils in Hungary.  
 
  
57 Under the act, in addition to the alr eady existing local workers’ councils, 
European workers’ councils must be formed at those companies which themselves 
operate or belong to a group that operates on a European  level (a company or 
group of companies operates on a European level if the company  or group of 
companies employs at least 1,000 employees in the EEA and at least 150 
employees in two or more Member States).  
The purpose of the European workers’ council is to ensure that the employer 
complies with the employees’ right to receive informat ion and to be consulted by 
in a formal manner regarding the status of the company and the employees. The 
European workers’ council has the right to request and receive general 
information from the company at least once a year and to be informed of certain 
particular circumstances affecting the employees.  
   
58 3. COMPETITION LAW  
3.1 Competition Law  
The main rules of Hungarian competition law are set out in Act LVII of 1996 on 
the Prohibition of Unfair Market Practices and Unfair Competition (the 
“Competition Act”). The Competition Act has been amended  many times since it 
entered into force in 1997. T he substantive provisions of the Competition Act 
correspond to the EC antitrust rules (101 and 102 TFEU).  
The Competition Act contains provisions on the prohibition of unfair competition, 
the unfair manipulation of business decisions, merger control, the abuse of 
dominant position and the prohibition of restrictive agreements and practices.  
Infringement of antitrust rules may trigger administrative, criminal and civil 
liability . 
Administrative enforcement is the task of the Competition Office, which has t he 
discretion to issue an injunction and to impose administrative fines on infringing 
companies. Criminal liability of individuals may arise only in cases related to 
concession tenders and public procurement procedures. In such cases criminal 
courts may im pose criminal sanctions both on individuals and companies that 
have been found to be in violation of the antitrust rules. In addition to 
administrative and criminal sanctions, the infringement of antitrust rules may also 
lead to private lawsuits before civ il courts, in which private plaintiffs can seek the 
termination of the infringement and/or raise damage claims.  
3.2 Scope of the Competition Act  
The Competition Act applies to the market activities of individuals and legal 
entities both with and without legal personality. Individuals and legal entities are 
collectively referred to as “undertakings”. The term undertaking includes all 
individuals and entities involved in the sale of goods or the provision of services. 
Individuals, however, are subject to th e antitrust rules of the Competition Act only 
if they pursue market activities as private entrepreneurs (i.e. as a non incorporated 
business).  
All restrictions of competition that have, or are likely to have, effects within the 
territory of Hungary, are s ubject to the Competition Act. Accordingly, even 
foreign undertakings are subject to these prohibitions , even if they do not have a 
corporate or other type of presence in Hungary. Similarly, the jurisdiction of the 
Competition Office can be established eve n if the conduct is carried out (solely) 
abroad, but it results in (at least potential) restrictive effects on the Hungarian 
market.  
 
  
59 3.3 Restrictive Agreements, Abuse of Dominant Position  
The Competition Office is not only bound by the Competition Act, but also by 
Regulation 1/2003 EC to apply Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union  when an agreement or an abusive unilateral 
action may affect trade betwee n Member States of the European Union.  
The main substantive rules of competition law include rules on the prohibition of 
restrictive agreements and on the prohibition of the abuse of a dominant  position.  
3.3.1 Restrictive Agreements  
Agreements or concerted pr actices between undertakings and decisions by 
associations of undertakings, public corporations, associations or other similar 
organizations (hereinafter together: “agreements”), which have as their object or 
potential or actual effect the prevention, rest riction or distortion of competition, 
shall be prohibited. Agreements concluded between undertakings, which are not 
independent of each other do not qualify as such kind of agreements.  
This prohibition applies , in particular, to  
 the direct or indirect fixing of purchase or selling prices or other 
business terms and conditions;  
 the limitation  or control of production, distribution, technical 
development or investment;  
 the allocation  of sources of supply, or the restriction of their choice as 
well as the exclusion of a specified group of consumers or trading 
parties from purchasing certain goods;  
 the allocation  of markets , exclusion from sales, or restriction of the 
choice of marketi ng possibilities ; 
 the hindering  of market entry;  
 cases, where, given transactions of the same value or character, there is 
discrimination between trading parties, including the application of 
prices, periods of payment, discriminatory selling or purchase  terms and 
conditions  or methods placing certain trading parties at a competitive 
disadvantage;  
 making the conclusion of contracts subject to the acceptance of 
obligations , which, by their nature or according to commercial usage do 
not belong to the subje ct of such contracts.  
With the exception of horizontal price cartels and market sharing, restrictive 
agreements are not prohibited if the parties’ aggregate market share is below 10 
per cent (so -called de minimis  agreements). Moreover, agreements falling in the 
safe harbor of a block exemption decree, or meeting the requirements of an 
individual exemption are automatically exempted from the prohibition.  
  
60 3.3.2 Prohibition of the abuse of dominant position  
A dominant position shall be deemed to be held on the relevant market by persons 
who are able to pursue their economic activities to a large extent independently of 
other market participants substantially without the need to take into account the 
market reactions of their suppliers, competitors, customers and other trading 
parties when deciding their market conduct.  
It shall be prohibited  to abuse a dominant position, particularly:  
 in business relations, including the application of standard contractual 
terms, to set unfair purchase or selling prices or to stipulate in any other 
manner unjustified advantages or to force the other party to accept 
disadvantageous conditions;  
 to limit production , distribution or technical development to the 
prejudice of consumers or trading parties;  
 to refuse, without justification, to create or maintain business relations 
appropriate for the type of transaction;  
 to influence the economic decisions of the other party in order to gain 
unjustified advantages;  
 to withdraw, without justification, goods from circulation or withhold 
them from trade prior to a price increase or with the purpose of causing 
a price increase or in any other manner which may possibly produce 
unjustified advantages or to cause competitive disadvantages;  
 to make the supply or acceptance of goods subject to the supply or 
acceptance of other goods, furthermore to make the conclusion of 
contracts subject to the acceptance of obligations which, by their nature 
or according to commercial usage, do not belong to th e subject of such 
contracts;  
 in the case of transactions which are equivalent in terms of their value or 
character to discriminate, without justification, against trading parties 
including in relation to the application of prices, periods of payment, 
discriminatory selling or purchase terms and conditions or methods 
thereby placing certain trading parties at a competitive disadvantage;  
 to set extremely low prices which are not based on greater efficiency in 
comparison with that of competitors and whic h are likely to drive out 
competitors from the relevant market or to hinder their market entry;  
 to hinder, without justification, market entry in any other manner; or  
 to create, without justification, disadvantageous market conditions for 
competitors, or  to influence their economic decisions in order to obtain 
unjustified advantages.  
   
61  
Factors considered when assessing whether a dominant position exists:  
 the costs and risks of entry to and exit from the relevant market, and the 
technical, economic and  legal conditions that have to be met;  
 the property status, financial strength and profitability of the undertaking 
or the group of undertakings (Article 15(2)), and the trends in their 
development;  
 the structure of the relevant market, the comparative market shares, the 
conduct of market partic ipants and the economic influence of the 
undertaking or the group of undertakings on the development of the 
market.  
3.3.3 Dawn Raids  
The Competition Office or the European Commission can conduct unannounced 
on-site in vestigations (“dawn raids”) to detect cartels effectively.  
Competition authorities have a wide range of investigation powers: they may 
search business premises and vehicles of parties, as well as private premises and 
vehicles of their current or former officers, employees and agents. In the course of 
on-site inspe ctions, they may enter and search any of the above premises, seize 
evidence, and seal premises where evidence is located. If necessary, they may also 
ask for the assistance of the police. In the course of a dawn raid, the authorities 
can search, copy or se ize both hard -copy and electronic documents. Besides 
searching computers and taking copies of certain electronic documents, e -mails, 
the authorities may also make a forensic copy of all electronic data available on 
certain computers or servers. In the cour se of its investigation the authorities may 
obtain and review business secrets, bank secrets, and personal data. The 
authorities are not allowed to review attorney -client privileged documents which 
qualify as privileged under relevant provisions of the Com petition Act or under 
EU competition law . It is the responsibility of the undertaking to claim that a 
document is protected under the attorney client privilege. During the dawn raid, 
case handlers conducting the inspection may ask questions from the 
repres entatives of the undertaking and from its employees.  
Undertakings and individuals subject to an investigation must fully cooperate with 
the competition authorities.  Procedural fines may be imposed both on 
undertakings party to an investigation and on indi viduals (e.g. employees, 
representatives of undertakings) who fail to cooperate with the authorities.  
3.3.4 Leniency  
(a) “Administrative immunity”  
As another means of detecting cartels effectively, the Competition 
Office operates a leniency program. Under this program, undertakings 
that cooperate with the Competition Office in detecting cartels, may 
receive full or partial immunity from the fines.  
  
62 Full immunity from the fine is available to the first undertaking 
providing such information and evidence on the cartel that enables the 
Competition Office either to acquire a court warrant authorizing a dawn 
raid or to prove the infringement.  
A reduction of the fine (up to 50%) is available if the undertaking 
provides the Competition Office with evidence representing significant 
added value with respect to the evidence already in the possession of the 
Competition Office.  
(b) “Criminal immunity”  
Administrative immunity does not imply in any way immunity from 
possible criminal sanctions. In cases that may poss ibly give rise to 
criminal liability of individuals, a separate criminal “immunity ” 
application must also be filed.  
(c) “Immunity from Private Claims”  
Administrative immunity does not give an absolute protection from civil 
law liability (i.e. liability for damages) either. Undertakings benefiting 
from full immunity remain jointly and severally liable for any damage 
caused, although they  may refuse to pay damages as long as plaintiffs 
can collect funds from any other party to the infringement.   
 
In addition to the above, it is important to note that administrative immunity is 
restricted to administrative antitrust enforcement in Hungary, and does not give 
any protection in investigations conducted by foreign (including EU) antitrust 
authorities. As the Europe an antitrust enforcement system has not (yet) been able 
to introduce a one -stop shop system (i.e. a system where immunity granted by one 
member of the ECN would mean immunity within the whole network), multiple 
leniency filings can not be avoided if the co nduct in question may affect several 
jurisdictions. Nevertheless, in cases concerning more than three EU Member 
States, if a full leniency application has been made with the Commission, the 
Competition Office also accepts a brief summary application which can be 
perfected later if necessary, and which temporarily protects the applicant’s 
position in the queue of (potential) leniency applicants.  
Leniency is not available in case of vertical infringements or for abuses of a 
dominant position.  
3.4 Prohibition of  Unfair Competition  
It is prohibited to conduct economic activities in an unfair manner, in particular, in 
a manner violating or jeopardizing the lawful interests of competitors, business 
partners and consumers, or in a way which is in conflict with the r equirements of 
business integrity.  
 
  
63 The following shall be construed as unfair conduct:  
(a) to infringe upon or jeopardize the good reputation or credibility of any 
competitor by communicating or disseminating untrue facts, or by 
misrepresenting true facts  with any false implication, as well as by any 
other practices;  
(b) to gain access to or use business secrets in an unfair manner, and to 
disclose such secrets to unauthorized parties or to publish them;  
(c) to make an unfair appeal to another party which is aim ed at dissolving 
an economic relationship maintained with a third party or at preventing 
the establishment of such a relationship;  
(d) produce, place on the market or advertise, without the express prior 
consent of the competitor goods or services with such typical external 
appearance, packaging or marking by which the competitor or its goods 
are normally recognized; furthermore, any such name, marking or 
indication of goods may not be used by which the competitor or its 
goods are normally recognized;  
(e) to int erfere with the integrity and fairness of bidding (in particular, 
public tender, invitation to tender), auctions and transactions conducted 
on an exchange market in any way.  
3.5 Prohibition of the Unfair Manipulation of Business Decisions  
It is prohibited to mislead business partners in economic competition . 
In particular, the following conduct shall be construed as misleading  business 
partners:  
(a) the disclosure of untrue facts with respect to the price and essential 
qualities of the goods,  or the misrepresentation of true facts with any 
false implication, the fitting of goods with misleading marking, or the 
provision of any information intended for misleading consumers in 
respect of the essential qualities the goods;  
(b) the suppression of the  goods’ non -conformity with legal provisions or 
with the requirements which the goods are commonly expected to 
satisfy, and that the use thereof requires the implementation of 
conditions substantially different from customary means;  
(c) where information suitable for misleading business partner s is disclosed 
in respect of circumstances related to the sale and distribution of the 
goods and influencing the business partners decision, in particular, in 
respect of the method of distribution, the terms of payme nt, any attached 
gift, discounts and any chances of winning;  
 
  
64 (d) where a purchase is falsely purported as an extraordinary bargain.  
In addition  to the above, it is prohibited to employ business methods intended to 
unjustifiably restrict the business partners’ freedom of choice.  
3.6 Merger Control  
In case of a concentration of companies, authorization from the Competition 
Office shall be obtained if  the aggregate net turnover of all groups of companies 
involved, and the net turnover of the companies controlled jointly by members of 
the groups of companies involved with other companies in the previous financial 
year exceeded fifteen billion forints, a nd among the groups of companies involved 
there are at least two groups with net sales revenues of five hundred million forints 
or more in the previous year together with the net sales revenues of companies 
controlled by members of the same group jointly  with other companies.  
 
From 1 July 2014, concentrations can not be implemented until the receipt of the 
Competition Office’s approval. Parallel to that, the statutory 30 -days deadline for 
the filing has been abolished.  
 
If the thresholds of the EU Merger  Regulation are met, the concentration must be 
approved by the European Commission, and not the Competition Office.  
 
  
65 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERT Y 
Hungarian law grants protection for all types of intellectual property, including 
trademarks, geographical indications and designations of origin, design rights, 
copyright and related rights, patents, supplementary protection certificate rights, 
plant variety rights and utility models. The Hungarian legislature provides 
different ways to enforce the IP rights, among others civil and criminal procedure, 
furthermore, the customs monitoring system.  
4.1 Types of IP Rights that have effect in respect of Hungary  
4.1.1 Trademark  
A trademark is any sign which is capable of being represented graphically and 
which can in the course of trade, distinguish the goods or services from those of 
other undertakings. Such signs may include words, devices, letters, and the shape 
of goods and t heir packaging. It is a basic tool of the economic competition and 
plays a very important role in marketing and advertisement.  
There are three types of registered trademark that provide protection in Hungary:  
(a) Hungarian National Trademark  
Hungarian registered trademarks are national rights managed by the 
Hungarian Intellectual Property Office in Budapest . 
(b) EU trademarks (or EUTMs)  
EU trademarks provide a single right that is enforceable throughout  the 
European Union, including Hungary. Th e EU trademark system is 
administered by the European Union Intellectual Property Office 
(EUIPO).  
(c) International trademarks (under the Madrid system)  
International trademarks registered through the Madrid system, where 
the trademark designates Hungary. The Madrid system is a multi -
national system based on two international treaties (the Madrid 
Agreement and the Protocol) and administered by the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO).  
4.1.2 Geographical indications and designations of origin  
Geograph ical indications and designations of origin are for protecting products 
whose characteristics are in some way based on their geographical origin.  A 
designation of origin indicates that a product or its quality is very closely 
associated with a particular region, its natural environment, e.g. Szegedi paprika.  
A geographical indication indicates that the quality and reputation of the product 
has a strong link to a region, Csabai kolbász.  
 
  
66  
4.1.3 Designs  
Designs protect the appearance of the whole or a part of a product. This can 
include contours, colours, shape, texture or ornamentation.  
4.1.4 Copyright and related rights  
Copyright is the right to grant the author the exclusive right to exploit its work, 
that is to prevent other people from copying or otherwise using original works of 
art. Copyright provides protection for works of literature, science, art and music, 
while the act does not provide for an exhaustive list of works capable of copyright 
protection . Copyright and related rights are protected automatically upon the 
creation of an original work. No registration of copyright is possible in Hungary. 
No transfer of the copyright that is pecuniary rights (there are some exceptions) 
and moral rights is pos sible.  
Related rights protection covers the rights of performers, producers of 
phonograms, broadcasting organizations and producers of databases.  
Hungarian Copyright Act prescribes special provisions for software and for 
databases. In the case of these types of works, pecuniary rights can be transferred. 
In case of software and databases entering into a written license agreement is not 
compulsory. In the case of software and databases, the Act also specifies special 
rules relating to the cases of free us e. 
According to the Copyright Act, employees - as authors - are entitled to receive 
royalty in case the employer transfers the pecuniary rights related to the work; or 
grant license to a third party to use the work created by the employee.  
4.1.5 Patents and su pplementary protection certificates  
Patents protect inventions on any field of technology. Hungarian law grants patent 
protection for both products and processes. The requirements to qualify for patent 
protection in Hungary are broadly similar to those in  most other developed 
countries, including the concepts of novelty, inventiveness and industrial 
application.  The maximum term of protection is 20 years calculated from the day 
of filing the patent application.  
A supplementary protection certificate (SPC ) is a certificate that can be issued to 
grant extended protection for patents that relate to medicinal or plant protection 
products. Because patented products of this type cannot be marketed until 
government authorities have conducted safety tests and iss ued a marketing 
authorization, the introduction of such products can be delayed for years, during 
which the normal 20 -year term of patent protection continues to run. The 
supplementary protection certificate becomes effective at the expiry of the basic 
patent (20 years) for a period equal to the period which has elapsed between the 
date of application and the date of receiving marketing authorization in the 
European Union.  The duration of the certificate cannot exceed five years.  
  
67 There are three ways o f obtaining patent protection in Hungary:  
(a) Applying to the Hungarian Patent Office;  
(b) Using the European patent system (established under the European 
Patent Convention);  
(c) Using the international patent system (established under the Patent Co-
operation Treaty) (“PCT”).  
All of the above mentioned systems eventually grant the same right, a national 
Hungarian patent. The European or PCT  systems may be preferable if the 
application is for protection in the territory of Hungary and one or more other 
countries that are party to either the European Patent Convention or the Patent Co -
operation Treaty, as one can file a single application that  results in national patents 
in more than one country.  
Hungary has signed the Unified Patent Court Agreement.  
4.1.6 Plant variety rights  
Plant variety right is a form of registered IP right that protects new varieties of 
plants.  
4.1.7 Utility model protection  
Utility model protection is registered protection for new technical solutions not 
reaching the level of patentable invention. Based on the utility model protection 
the right holder has the exclusive right to exploit the utility model or to provide a 
licens e to other persons authorizing exploitation. The protection has a definite 
term of 10 years, after that period the utility model becomes public domain.  
4.2 IP Law Enforcement  
4.2.1 Customs Monitoring  
Customs will intercept and seize suspected infringing goods  on  the basis of an 
accepted Customs Monitoring Application if it detects goods it suspects to 
infringe IP rights. Under the so called “simplified procedure” it may even be 
possible to have the goods destroyed under Customs control without there being 
any cou rt judgment on whether an IP right has been infringed.  
4.2.2 Civil proceedings  
A civil lawsuit may be initiated for the infringement of your IP rights and/or for 
unfair competition against the infringer. IP infringement litigation with respect to 
registered IP  rights must be based on IP rights that are valid in Hungary. The 
Capital Regional Court (Budapest) has exclusive jurisdiction to hear IP 
infringement cases, while regional courts have jurisdiction to hear unfair 
competition cases and copyright cases.  
 
68 4.2.3 Preliminary injunction  
The IP right holder may request the court to grant a preliminary injunction even 
before filing a statement of claim. The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to 
provide immediate relief for the holder of the IP right (e.g., the seizure of the 
infringing goods). The court can order preliminary injunction if the requested 
action is necessary to prevent imminent and direct damage, or to preserve the 
existing status of the litigants, which gave rise to the legal dispute or for such l egal 
protection of the petitioner, which deserves special considerations and if the 
disadvantages brought by the injunction do not exceed the advantages gained by 
granting injunction.  
4.2.4 Criminal proceedings  
The IP right holder can report a crime to the Cus toms, which will investigate 
further and prosecute the infringer. A criminal action can be brought irrespective 
of a pending civil lawsuit. Criminal prosecution of IP infringement in Hungary is 
not as developed as enforcing IP rights in civil proceedings. Authorities and 
prosecutors dealing with criminal reports are generally not specialized in IP law.

10. LEGISLATION IN THE H IGH -TECH SECTORS AND DAT A 
PROTECTION  
 Introduction  
Hungary opened its electronic communications market (telecommunications 
market) at the end of 2001. With its EU accession on 1 May 2004, it ensured 
compliance with the rules of the 2002 EU Regulatory Package. This then led to 
the adoption of a new electron ic communications act, which harmonises 
Hungarian rules with those of the EU. The electronic communications market has 
been constantly changing and continuously developing since the implementation 
of the 2009 EU Regulatory Package. The applicable IT/Commun ication legislation 
is primarily determined by the harmonization obligations of Hungary.  
During the last few years, the practical application of the above legislation has 
become considerably smoother. The realization of E -government (E -
administration) has shown considerable progress.  
Since 2010, Hungary has a powerful independent national regulatory authority, the 
National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NRA) which resulted from 
the merger of the National Communications Authority and the Nation al Radio and 
Television Board. The NRA is responsible for the supervision of the electronic 
communication market and the media market.  
4.3 Electronic Communication  
4.3.1 Legislation  
The basic rules on electronic communications are set out in Act C of 2003 on the 
Electronic Communication (ECA) which provides an overall framework for 
market players. In addition to the  ECA, several decrees have been adopted by the 
Government and the relevant Minister, and recently also by the President of the 
NRA. The decrees contai n special rules, for example, on data protection, number 
portability and the like. In addition, the NRA is empowered to carry out regulatory 
as well as supervisory tasks, including but not limited to the designation of SMP 
undertakings, imposing remedies, etc. 
In general, the 2009 EU Regulatory Package was successfully implemented, and, 
resultantly, Hungary has technology neutral legislation. New market players 
entered the relevant markets, among others, in the mobile telephony segment and 
new services wer e introduced. However, because of the economic downturn, the 
consumer segment has been decreasing, although the business sector experienced 
slight growth.  
  
70 The ECA defines its scope in a manner similar to the relevant EU directives: it 
applies to electro nic communication activities and to all other activities where 
radio -frequency signals are generated. The term, “electronic communication 
activity” covers activities related to electronic communication networks and 
electronic communication services. The EC A defines electronic communications 
activity as “an activity in the course of which signals, signs, texts, images, voice or 
messages of any other nature and generated in any form that can be interpreted, 
are transmitted via electronic communications networ ks to one or more users, 
including, in particular, electronic communications services, the operation of 
electronic communications networks and equipment, distribution of terminal 
equipment and related services”. Hungarian law defines those networks and 
services in terms similar to their Framework Directive definition.  
The territorial scope of the ECA applies to all electronic communication activities 
performed in, or directed to, the territory of Hungary. The ECA applies both to 
service providers and cust omers. It contains no restrictions regarding the 
nationality of a service provider. The ECA does not apply to information society 
services. Separate legislation regulates, among other issues, radio and television 
activities, including the digital switch ov er. 
Hungarian laws contain no specific guidance on the provision of complex 
electronic communication services. Hungary has not passed any VoIP specific 
laws. Basically, VoIP services must be assessed under the general electronic 
communications regime whic h applies to VoIP in limited cases only.  
4.3.2 Notification obligation and the role of the NRA  
In order to provide electronic communication services in Hungary, the service 
provider must notify the NRA and comply with the relevant legislation.  
The powers and  obligations of the NRA related to the electronic communication 
industry are consistent with the Framework Directive. The NRA may impose 
fines. The decisions of the NRA are subject to judicial appeal.  
The NRA is also responsible for analyzing the differen t communication markets; 
it performs this activity in accordance with the recommendation of the European 
Commission. The Agency may impose obligations on the service providers.  
4.4 Media  
According to the Hungarian Constitution, freedom of speech and freedom  of press 
are valuable constitutional rights.  
The Media Services and Mass Media Act (Media Act) and the new Act on the 
Freedom of Press entered into force in 2011. That legislation implemented the 
Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS Directive - Directive 2010/13/EU) 
in Hungary. In general, the legislation is in line with the AVMS Directive, 
however, the scope of it is broader.  
 
 
71 The Media Act contains broad registration and notification requirements. Linear 
media services subject to the Media Act p rovided by a media service provider 
with a registered office (domicile) in Hungary must be registered by the NRA. 
Services may be provided after that registration has occurred. On -demand and 
ancillary media services subject to the Media Act, provided by a media service 
provider with a registered office (domicile) in Hungary, also must be registered. 
The registration requirement applies to media products published by a publisher 
with a registered office (domicile) in Hungary. The Media Act also requires onli ne 
media products and newsportals to be registered which is unique.  
The Media Act gives the NRA strong rights to enforce the Media Act. Within the 
NRA, the Media Council is the most important decision -making body. The Media 
Council may impose fines, the a mount of which depends on the several factors 
defined in the Media Act. Although the maximum amount of the fines has been 
increased as compared to the former legislation, judicial control - with a short 
statutory deadline for the reaching of a court decisi on - is available to service 
providers, who may request a court to suspend the obligation to pay a fine 
accessed by the Media Council until a final judicial decision is reached. The 
power of the Media Council is not considered to be extraordinary in Hungar y. 
The Media Act also introduced some concentration related rules. The Media Act 
says that where there is a merger of two groups of companies bearing editorial 
responsibility for media content, then, if the primary objective of the undertakings 
concerned is the distribution of media content to the general public, the 
Competition Authority must obtain the position statement of the Media Council 
before approving the concentration. The issuance of the Media Council’s position 
statement is subject to the payme nt of an administrative fee.  
Finally, the Act on Digital Switchover sets out the deadline for the digital 
switchover for access to digital audiovisual media services. The final deadline was 
31 December 2014. According to the NRA's report, the digital swit chover had 
been successfully implemented throughout the territory of Hungary.  
4.5 E-commerce and some related legislation  
Act CVIII of 2001 on Electronic Commerce and on Information Society Services 
(“E-Commerce Act”) is the basic e -commerce legislation in Hungary. It applies to 
information society and e -commerce services directed to Hungary. If such services 
are provided from another EU Member State, the country of origin principle 
applies. The E -Commerce Act is in line with Directive 2000/31/EC.  
 
 
72 According to the E -Commerce Act, the term information society service covers 
services provided electronically - normally for financial consideration - at a 
distance and at the individual request of the recipient of the services. E -commerce 
services are als o information society services.  
Information society services may be provided without authorization (however, the 
Electronic Communication Act requires notification in certain cases).  
The E -Commerce Act contains rules regarding electronic contracts (which  are 
allowed under Hungarian law), the information which has to be provided to 
recipients, liability related rules (liability of the service provider and the 
intermediary service provider), etc.  
The services of the major Internet companies are available in Hungary. The 
tendency is that companies do not establish webstores in the different 
jurisdictions, but provide services from one EU Member State which services are 
available from other Member St ates as well. Even US companies established 
webstores in the EU in order to benefit from the EU e -commerce legislation.   
Hungary has adopted legislation on electronic signatures (Act XXXV of 2001 on 
electronic signatures). According to this act, if a doc ument is signed with at least 
qualified electronic signature, it qualifies as a written document.  
As for Hungarian top level domains  (.HU ccTLD s), delegation rules are regulated 
in the Domain Registration Rules which are issued and amended from time to ti me 
by the Council of Hungarian Internet Service Providers. Section 1.1.1 of the 
Domain Registration  Rules lays down that domains  may be applied for by:  
a. any citizen of the European Union;  
b. any natural person holding a residence permit for Hungary or  
c. any ent ity established by virtue of law, entered in the records of or 
registered with an authority or court in the territory of the  European 
Union; and  
d. any owner of a trademark registered with the Hungarian  Intellectual 
Property Office or protected in Hungary ( such as European Union Trade 
Marks and International Marks protected in Hungary).  
Accordingly, an owner of any trademark protected in Hungary as well as EU 
residents may register .Hu ccTLDs without being Hungarian residents . An 
application for the registration of a domain must be submitted to one of the 
assigned “registrars” who arranges the registration of the domain with the Council 
of Hungarian Internet Service Providers that registers Hungarian top level 
domains.  
4.6 The Hungarian data protection, data transfer and privacy regime  
4.6.1 General overview  
73 As of 1 January 2012 a new data protection act, Act No. CXII of 2011 on 
Information Rights and the Freedom of Information is in force (“Data Protection 
Act”). The Hungarian data protection regime is consi dered one of the strictest 
within the EU; however, the Data Protection Act  is more business friendly than 
the previous legislation.  
In addition to this general legislation, sector specific laws contain specific data 
protection rules, for example, in case of an employment relationship, the Labor 
Code or in case of electronic communication services, the ECA  and the related 
decrees contai n the relevant regulations.  
4.6.2 Data Protection Act  
The Data Protection Act applies to the processing of any information relating or 
otherwise connected to an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data 
Subject”).  An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or 
indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more 
factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social 
identity.  Any conclusion concerning the natural person that can be drawn from the 
information being processed also qualifies as protected personal data (“Personal 
Data”).  In the course of data processing, such information is treated as Personal 
Data as long as the Data Subject remains identifiable.  Th us, the term of Personal 
Data is widely defined, as well as the term data processing, which covers, among 
others, collecting, recording and storing, processing, utilizing Personal Data. The 
law also applies to the processing of sensitive personal data.   
The Data Protection Act applies to those persons, including any natural or legal 
person or organization, who determine the purposes for which and the manner in 
which any Personal Data is, or is to be, processed and who execute the data 
processing or appoin t someone to process the Personal Data (“Data Controller”). 
The legislation applies to third -party data processors (“Data Processors”) as well. 
According to the law, Data Processors perform technical data processing activities 
upon the instruction of the D ata Controller.  
If the Data Controller decides to apply a Data Processor, they must conclude a 
written agreement. The legislation allows Data Processors to appoint further data 
processors (subprocessors) in line with the instructions of the Data Controlle r.  
The Data Protection Act applies to any processing of Personal Data in the territory 
of Hungary. It also applies if a Data Controller processing Personal Data outside 
the EU employs a Data Processor whose registered address or place of business 
(branch ) or habitual residence is in Hungary, or if it makes use of equipment 
situated in the territory of Hungary unless such equipment is used solely for the 
purpose of data transit throughout the territory of the EU.  
  
74 4.6.3 The legal grounds of the data processing   
The Data Protection Act failed to properly implemented those Articles of the Data 
Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) that regulate the legal basis of data 
processing (i.e. criteria for making data processi ng legitimate). In light of a 
decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union , there are good arguments 
that in this regard, Article 7 of the Data Protection Directive has direct effect (but 
not h orizontal direct effect ) in Hungary. Therefore, in Hu ngary, instead of the 
relevant provisions of the Data Protection Act, a Data Controller could directly 
rely on the criteria of the data processing as defined in the Data Protection 
Directive. As a result of the above, the Hungarian data protection regime b ecame 
similar to the data protection regime of other EU Member States.  
4.6.4 Information / Notice Requirements  
The processing of Personal Data is legal, if the Data Subjects have received 
adequate information about the data processing. Among others, the Data Subject 
has to receive information on all the relevant facts about data processing, 
including: a detailed description of the Personal Data types to be processed; the 
duration of the proposed processing operations; the purposes of processing the 
Personal Da ta; the legal basis of data processing; description of data transfers; the 
use of a Data Processor; the rights and legal remedies of the Data Subject.  
As a general principle, only such Personal Data may be processed that is essential 
for the purpose for w hich it was collected and which is suitable to achieve the 
purpose of processing.  Even in such case, Personal Data may only be processed to 
the extent and the duration necessary to achieve the given purpose. Data 
processing must be guided by the objective  of the collection.  The Data Controller 
must keep the Personal Data accurate and complete.  
The Data Subject has several rights. Among others, the Data Subject may request 
information about the processing of his or her Personal Data. The Data Subject is 
entitled to request the blocking, correction, or deletion of his or her Personal Data, 
and to object to the processing of such data.  
The Data Controller is responsible for taking appropriate technical and 
organizational measures necessary to ensure data s ecurity. To certain Data 
Controllers, for example, financial institutions, specific requirements contained in 
the financial laws apply.  
4.6.5 Registration requirement  
The general rule is that every data processing activity has to be registered with the 
Hungari an National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information 
(“Authority”). In general, data processing cannot be commenced before 
registration. There are several exemptions from the registration obligation. Among 
others, data processing for purpos es of maintaining an employment relationship, 
customer relationship or supplier relationship does not have to be registered.  
  
75  
4.6.6 International Data Transfers  
With the introduction of Data Protection Act, the rules of international data 
transfer became more business friendly. Personal Data (including Sensitive 
Personal Data) may be transferred outside Hungary to Data Controllers or Data 
Processors located in non -EU countries if (i) the Data Subject gives his explicit 
consent; or (ii) the laws of the non -EEA third country in question afford an 
adequate level of protection. Among others, adequate level of protection is 
achieved if Personal Data is transferred to a country that is recognized by an EU 
Commission decision to provide adequate level of protectio n; or the Data 
Controller and the recipient sign Model Clauses which is an agreement drafted and 
published by the European Commission, applied in other EU Member States as 
well. Furthermore, groups of companies may also ensure adequate level of 
protection by implementing binding corporate rules (BCRs).  
 
Transfer of personal data within EEA Member States is treated as a transmission 
within Hungary.  
4.6.7 Enforcement  
The infringement of the data protection laws may have administrative, civil and 
criminal law consequences. The Authority may impose administrative fines. 
Additionally, the Authority may, among other actions, prohibit the data processing 
(though judicial recourse is available against the decision of the Authority) or 
require that the unlawfully pro cessed data be blocked, deleted or destroyed.  
 
  
76 11. THE HUNGARIAN BANKIN G SYSTEM  
4.7 General overview  
4.7.1 Development of the banking system  
The Hungarian banking system has been converging rapidly to the banking 
systems of the advanced developed countries. This process is reflected in the scale 
and quality of its products and services offered by Hungarian banks, operational 
reliability, prudential regulations and profitability, as well as management 
schemes. One of the reasons of such quick improvement is th at most of the 
Hungarian banks have come under the control of foreign strategic investors during 
the bank consolidation in the nineties.  Consequently, all of the leading Hungarian 
players have been operating as a local subsidiary of top Italian, Austrian,  Belgian, 
German and American banks, thus there are several different corporate culture 
competing for the dominant role of the Hungarian market. The local subsidiaries 
of the foreign European mammoths are operating based on their major home 
principles and philosophy, while the regulations of National Bank of Hungary  
also developed to the level of western countries and became EU conform by the 
date of accession to the EU.  
After abolishing the former separation of the commercial and investment banking 
activity, the laws have allowed the existence of universal commercial banks, 
hence the major commercial banks have integrated their investment service 
provider companies in the past few years.  
The operational efficiency of the banks is adequate, while the  higher cost levels in the 
ration of balance sheet total are due to the still lower level of the banking penetration. 
The balance sheet total of the banking sector  is 90 percent of the annual GDP in 201 4. 
Nevertheless, the Hungarian economic growth lags b ehind other regional countries 
because of the  long lasting consequences of the financial crisis, which creates 
somewhat adverse business environment for the banks as well. Based on the Country 
Risk Assessment of the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authorit y dated June 2013, 
major systematic risks in respect of the Hungarian banking system are permanently low 
profitability rates, in certain cases even permanent losses and the structure and source 
of profits: in 2012 and in 2013 the financial results were pos itively affected by the 
results of the foreign branches of the Hungarian parent credit institutions and the more 
favorable treatment of the calculation of amortisation, however, the interest incomes 
representing the core activity of credit institutions hav e been decreased significantly 
and continuously.  
Commercial banks have been shifting the focus of their expansion to the retail market 
and small and medium -sized companies in order to offset the decreasing margin on the 
higher end of the multinational cor porate clients, which objective is officially supported 
by the National Bank of Hungary: in June 2013 the Credit Facility Program of the 
National Bank of Hungary has been launched, according to which the National Bank of 
Hungary grants refinancing credit f acilities to commercial banks, and those commercial 
banks grants credit facilities to small and medium sized enterprises at below the 
average interest rates both for new projects and for the replacement of credit facilities 
denominated in foreign currency to credit facilities denominated in HUF. Competition 
in pricing and in product innovation is back by rapidly enlarging nation -wide branch 
networks  of the top 7 -8 universal financial institutions.  
 
77 The domestic private or state owned equity of banks is barely more less 10 per 
cent in Hungary the foreign direct ownership proportion exceeds 75 per cent. At 
the end of 2013 the number of credit institutions of the banking sector is 37 based 
on the data of the National Bank of Hungary, of which:  
 the number o f commercial banks 34  
 specialized credit institutions 11

4.7.2 Financing Activity  
Hungarian banks are active in the fields of not just retail but also corporate lending 
including sophisticated structured and project finance transactions. The major 
Hungarian banks are active not just in Hungary but also provide loans to 
companies and projects in other CEE countries and Russia.  
Hungarian banks, led by the biggest Hungarian bank, OTP  Bank Nyrt. made 
several acquisitions of banks in the region, which acquisitions were the basis of 
their regional expansion.

78 4.8 Legal Overview  
The legal framework of the present banking system is based on Act CCXXVII of 
2013 on Credit Institutions and Financial Enterprises (the “Credit Institutions 
Act”), Act CXXXVIII of 2007 on Investment Firms and Commodity Service 
Providers and on the rules of  their activity (the “Investment Firm Act”), Act CXX 
of 2001 on the Capital Markets (the “Capital Markets Act”) and Act XVI of 2014 
on Collective Investment Schemes and its Managers  and decrees of the Finance 
Minister, the Government and the Governor of th e Hungarian National Bank. 
Regulation of the Hungarian banking system is generally in line with the relevant 
EU banking standards.  
4.8.1 EU Membership  
Hungary became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004. Membership 
of the EU has resulted in Hungary adopting and implementing various EU 
directives . Changes have, therefore, been made to Hungarian banking law and 
accounting rules in order to harmoniz e them with EU directives. EU accession has 
greatly enhanced the international integration of the domestic money market and 
has strengthened the close relationship between credit institutions and their foreign 
parent banks, the majority of Hungarian banks being owned by foreign credit 
institutions.  
As of 1 January 2006 Hungary has implemented Commission Directive 
2003/6/EC on insider dealing and market manipulation (the Market Abuse 
Directive) and Commission Directive 2004/72/EC implementing directive 
2003 /6/EC as regards accepted market practices, the definition of insider 
information in relation to derivatives and commodities, the drawing up of lists of 
insiders, the notification of managers’ transactions and the notification of 
suspicious transactions.  
 Act CXII of 1996 on the Credit Institutions and Financial Enterprises (the 
“Original Credit Institutions Act”) was abolished as of 1 January 2014 in order to 
adopt the new Credit Institutions Act. Based on the official commentary to the 
Credit Institution s Act, the purpose of the adoption thereof has been twofold: first, 
the Credit Institutions Act implements (i) the prudential rules and requirements of 
the Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on, inter 
alia, the prudential re quirement applicable to credit institutions (the “Prudential 
Directive”) and (ii) its implementing regulation, the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 
of the European Parliament and of the Council (the “Prudential Regulation”), and 
second it was essential to resta te the structure and wording of the Original Credit 
Institutions in order to eliminate minor logical and wording flaws caused by its 
frequent amendments.  
 
 
 
 
79 The legal regime of the central credit information system has been implemented 
into a new act: the Act CXXII of 2011 on Central Credit Information System (the 
“Credit Information Act”). As of the Credit Information Act the Central Credit 
Information System operates as a complete list of borrowers; certain data of the 
borrower set out in the Credit I nformation Act may be registered not only in the 
case of the breach of the credit contract by the borrower  - which remained a 
obligatory case of registration - but by the fact of the execution of the credit 
agreement. The purpose of the regulation is to c reate a good borrower list upon the 
approval of the borrower; the relevant credit institution is entitled to transfer 
certain data of the borrower to an other credit institution where for example the 
borrower intends to obtain a new credit facility. Nevert heless the purpose of 
safeguarding of the rights of the individuals registered in the Central Credit 
Information has not changed; the scope of available remedies is still appealing, 
offering safety against the accidental errors in data handling.  
In the fr amework of the harmonization of national law with EU law, Hungary has 
implemented Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as 
amended from time to time (the “MiFID”) and Directive 2004/109/EC on the 
harmonization of transparency requiremen ts in relation to information about 
issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, as amended 
from time to time (the “Transparency Directive”). Hungary has implemented the 
Transparency Directive by means of implementing Directive 2 007/14/EC on 
detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of Directive 
2004/109/EC on the harmonization of transparency requirements in relation to 
information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated 
market.  
Hungary has also implemented (a) Directive 2006/73/EC implementing Directive 
2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards 
organizational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and 
defined terms for the purposes of t hat Directive and (b) Directive 2007/16/EC 
implementing Council Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, 
regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective 
investment in transferable securities (UCITS) as regards the  clarification of certain 
definitions. As of 14 December 2007 Hungary implemented Directive 2005/60/EC 
on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money 
laundering and terrorist financing. As a result of the implementation of th e above -
mentioned directives, the Hungarian Parliament has passed the Investment Firm 
Act, which entered into force on 1 December 2007. Further the Credit Institutions 
Act and the Capital Markets Act were amended in various respects.  
The Prudential Direct ive and the Prudential Regulation not only sets out stricter 
prudential rules, but those laws also require the clear distinction of the payment 
services from other financial services, not only in terms of distinct legal rules but also 
in terms of separate organisational provisions. In order to achieve such effect, the Act 
CCXXXV of 2013 on Certain Payment Services Providers (the “Payment Services 
Providers Act”) was adopted, whereby the payment services are to be offered by a new 
type of institution, the pa yment services institutions, which are entitled to offer other 
financial services than payment services only in limited scope and under limited 
circumstances. The Payment Services Providers Act also incorporates the applicable 
rules for electronic money in stitutions and vouc her issuers.  
80 4.8.2 Domestic Background  
Role of the National Bank of Hungary  
Act CXXXIX of 2013 on the National Bank of Hungary (the “National Bank 
Act”) regulates the Hungarian  National Bank and its current position in the 
System of European Central Banks.  
The National Bank of Hungary is responsible for determining and executing the 
monetary policy. In determining the monetary policy the National Bank of 
Hungary is relatively i ndependent but as a recent development the National Bank 
of Hungary shall consider and comply with the European monetary policy 
determined by the System of European Central Banks.  
The primary objective of the National Bank of Hungary shall be to achieve and 
maintain price stability in correspondence with the international and European 
standards. To achieve this the principal instrument is the central bank base rate. 
By increasing and decreasing such base rate the National Bank of Hungary is able 
to affect  various economical indicators indirectly. Please note that there are further 
instruments to be utilized.  
Although the National Bank of Hungary has no legal obligation to support  
Hungary’s credit institutions, it may serve as a lender of last resort to a credit 
institution if the credit institution faces temporary liquidity difficulties which 
jeopardize the stability of the financial system. However, the National Bank of 
Hungary is not permitted to grant any financial aid to the government. Any loans 
grant ed by the National Bank of Hungary in its capacity as lender of last resort to 
Hungary’s credit institutions qualify as general unsecured obligations of the credit 
institutions. In respect of the refinancing credit facilities provided to commercial 
banks b y the National Bank of Hungary, please refer to Clause 12.1.1.  
The National Bank of Hungary reviews reports filed by banks and maintains a 
publicly available database on the Hungarian Banking System. Furthermore, it 
continuously evaluates the status and p ublishes all information regarding the 
financial position and condition of Hungarian credit institutions and of the 
Hungary itself.  
 
  
81 The European Central Bank and the National Bank of Hungary  
There  is no official date indicated by the Hungarian government for Hungary to 
become a member of the Economic and Monetary Union (the EMU). The 
financial experts’ analysis is controversial in respect of Hungary’s financial 
situation. Prior to joining the EMU, the Hungary will accede to the ERM -II 
system, as of the date of preparing this memorandum Hungary is not the member 
of the the ERM -II system . 
Hungary is presently at the second stage of monetary integration, therefore it still 
retains the discretion to se t its own monetary policy. Nevertheless, pursuant to the 
Treaty of Maastricht, it is bound to follow a strategy of convergence. The 
Governor of the National Bank of Hungary is a member  of the Governing Council 
of the European Central Bank.  
The National Bank of Hungary as the legal successor of the Hungarian 
Financial Supervisory Authority  
As of 1 October 2013,  the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority merged into 
the Hungarian National Bank pursuant to the National Bank Act, whereby the role as 
the financial supervisory and regulatory authority was transferred to and is carried 
out by the National Bank of Hungary. Such fundamental change, however, did not 
reshape substantially the financial regulatory environment: simply the supervisory 
authority ve sted with the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority is exercised by 
the National Bank of Hungary.  
The National Bank of Hungary is an administrative regulator of the Hungarian 
Government and has nation -wide jurisdiction. It is headed by the governor who is 
appointed by the president upon the proposition of the prime minister  for 6 years .  
The Financial Conciliatory Committee is a professionally independent committee 
which is operated and financed by National Bank of Hungary. The Financial 
Conciliator y Committee’s scope concerns consumer contracts entered into 
between a consumer and one of the various institutions being supervised by the 
National Bank of Hungary, i.e. which include but not limited to credit institutions, 
insurance providers and payment  services institutions. In short the Financial 
Conciliatory Committee is an extra judicial organization, which purpose is to 
settle dispute without the involvement of ordinary courts. The director of the 
Financial Conciliatory Committee is appointed by the  governor of the National 
Bank of Hungary.  
The National Bank of Hungary holds wide -ranging powers in particular but not 
limited to under the Credit Institutions Act, the Investment Firm Act, the National 
Bank of Hungary Act and the Capital Markets Act to license and supervise the 
establishment and operation of institutions under each respective act mentioned 
above.  
As of 1 January 2006, the supervisory role of the National Bank of Hungary has 
been harmonized with the relevant EU Directives with regard to insider dealing 
and market manipulation.  
 
82 As a recent development, the National Bank of Hungary launched an electronic 
platform, called the ERA System, which purpose is to replace the conventional 
notification method via  mail to an electronic notification system. Pursuant to the 
applicable Decree s of the Governor of the National Bank of Hungary, certain 
notifications and submission set out in the relevant finance related laws are 
obliged to be filed via the ERA System to have a legal effect.  
4.8.3 Banking Regulations  
The Credit Institutions Act, the Investment Firm Act,  the Capital Markets Act and 
the Payment Services Providers Act set out the regulatory framework for the 
Hungarian banking system.  Additionally, the Act CLXII of 2009 on the Credit 
provided to consumers became into the center of attent ion according to the 
common usage of unfair terms and conditions by credit institutions  in Hungary.   
Specific rules not regulated in detail under these Acts are set out in Government 
decrees or decrees issued by the minister responsible for finance, decree s issued 
by the Governor of National Bank of Hungary.    
Capital Adequacy  
According to the Credit I nstitutions Act and in line with European  regulations, 
banks must have a registered capital of at least HUF  2,000 million (about EUR 6,4 
million). Mortgage credit institutions are specialized credit institutions with a 
registered capital requirement of at least HUF 3,000 million (about EUR 9.6 
million), which must be in the form of cash contribution. The amount  of a credit 
institution’s equity may not be less than the minimum amount of its re gistered 
capital. If the amount of a credit institution’s equity falls below the registered 
capital, the National Bank of Hungary will give the credit institution a maximum 
of 18 months to bring its equity to the required level.  National Bank of Hungary 
may also request the board of directors of such credit institution to summon the 
general meeting thereof. Should the credit institution do not cure such breach of 
prudential r equirements, the National Bank of Hungary is entitled to impose other 
sanction set out in the National Bank Act over the credit institution in breach.  
In order to maintain solvency and its ability to satisfy its liabilities, a credit 
institution must at a ll times have own funds equal to the amount of the risk of the 
financial and investment activities it engages in, and pursuant to detailed rules its 
own funds may not in any event be less than the minimum amount of its registered 
capital.  
Trading Book  
By adopting the Prudential Regulation the particulars of the content and keeping 
of trading books are regulated in comprehensive way. Based on the direct 
applicability of EU regulations, the rules contained in the Prudential Regulation 
are directly applica ble for Hungarian credit institutions. Pursuant to the Prudential 
Regulation, in order to ascertain a credit institution’s capital requirements on 
trading  and certain other long and short positions held for the purpose of trading or 
for hedging transaction  behind such trading transactions, a trading book must be 
kept to record the financial instruments in the trading portfolio that are exposed to 
the market risks.  
83 In addition the trading book keeping obligation, the credit institutions shall have 
consiste nt by -laws and internal regulations on the handling of the trading book and 
the positions listed therein, such by -laws shall provide for, inter alia, the estimate 
on the capability of the credit institution to identify the risks associated with a 
particula r position, and for the method and estimated timeframe of closing such 
positions and for any restriction set out by applicable laws or operational rules, 
which may hinder such closing.  
General Reserves  
A credit institution must create general reserves from its after -tax profits to offset 
the losses incurred during its activities prior to paying dividends and shares. A 
credit institution must place 10 per cent, of its respective annual after -tax profits 
into the general reserve. (Upon request, a credit institution may be exempted by 
the National Bank of Hungary from  the obligation to create general reserves if the 
amount of the credit institution’s solvency capital is at least equal to 150 percent 
of the m inimal amount of solvency capital as set out by the Credit Institutions Act 
and if it has no negative profit reserves.)  
A credit institution may pay dividends or shares only if it has created the general 
reserves described as set out above in the calendar  year, or if the the National 
Bank of Hungary has granted exemption from the obligation to create general 
reserves. A credit institution is entitled to use general reserves only to settle the 
losses incurred during its activities. A credit institution is e ntitled to re -allocate its 
available profit reserves in whole or in part into general reserves.  
Solvency Capital and Risk Provisions  
Based on the implementation of the Prudential Directive, a credit institution must 
have a sufficient amount of solvency c apital. The minimal amount of the solvency 
capital of credit institutions is determined by the Credit Institutions Act and the 
Prudential Regulation.  
The solvency capital must be enough to secure, at all times, the risk of a bank’s 
business activity to provide continuous solvency and to assure that the bank’s 
obligations are fulfilled. The solvency capital cannot be less than the  sum of  
(A) the minimum ca pital requirement under Section 92 of the Prudential 
Regulation;  
(B) additional requirement imposed by the Hungarian National Bank as part 
of a supervisory proceeding; and  
(C) combined capital buffer requirement under Section 86 -96. of the Credit 
Institutions Act;  
but at least the minimum registered capital requirement for credit institutions.  
 
  
84 Pursuant to the Credit Institutions Act and the Prudential Regulation, the credit 
institutions are obliged to reserve the following types of capital buffers, as 
applicabl e: 
(A) capital reserve buffer;  
(B) anti-cyclic capital buffer;  
(C) capital buffer of credit institutions with global and systemic importance;  
(D) systemic risk capital buffer.  
The Credit Institution Act further elaborates on the detailed rules of each type of 
capital buffers, however, it is important to note, that under limited circumstances 
(correlation and cumulation of the above types of capital buffers) not each and 
every ty pe of capital buffer shall be reserved in their entire amount.  
We note, however, that despite the fact, that both the Credit Institutions Act and 
the Prudential Regulation are in effect and directly applicable, the above set of 
rules of capital buffers ar e not to be complied with the credit institutions as of 1 
January 2014, rather in the course of a longer period specified for each type of 
buffers by the Credit Institutions Act in order to ensure the proper preparation of 
the concerned credit institutions . 
Further to the above, the credit institutions shall have a reliable, efficient and 
comprehensive internal strategies and methods to maintain and reserve the 
solvency capital sufficient to cover present and future risks arising out of the 
operation of th e business of the credit institutions.  
4.8.4 The Hungarian money and capital markets  
The market of the Hungarian Forint wa s fully liberalized in 2001. Until the end of 
February 2008, the Hungarian Forint was set to the official intervention band of 
240.01 - 324.71 HUF/EUR,  and as of February 2008 the HUF is a floating 
currency.  
Both the Budapest Stock Exchange and the gover nment securities market are 
integrated into the global capital markets. The extent of corporate bonds 
(including banks’ commercial papers and mortgage bonds) has been relatively 
limited as a result of the abundant liquidity and cheap funding opportunities of the 
commercial banking system. Unfavourable funding environment resulting from 
the 2007 sub -prime financial crisis has increased the costs of the securities -based 
funding of both the banking and the corporate sectors.  
 
  
85  
12. BANKRUPTCY AND RESTRUCTURING  
The Bankruptcy Act generally applies to all types of business organizations and 
their creditors recognized under Hungarian law. The Bankruptcy Act also applies 
to legal entities registered in a Member State of the European Union provided tha t 
main solvency proceedings or secondary proceedings may be conducted. Certain 
other laws specify special provisions applicable to certain special entities (such as 
credit institutions or insurance companies) in addition to or instead of those of the 
Bankr uptcy Act. The procedures to be followed in insolvency of non -business 
organizations can be distinguished by dividing these organizations into two 
groups. The first group contains associations, foundations and other nonprofit 
organizations; in relation to this group of organizations the provisions of the 
Bankruptcy Act are applicable. The second group contains any other non -business 
organizations (such as government agencies), which are not regulated under 
Hungarian law by means of general rules, but are su bject to the particular statutes 
relating to those entities.  
All assets of a company existing on the commencement date and acquired in the 
course of its bankruptcy, liquidation proceedings are subject  to such proceedings.  
During liquidation proceedings the tax, customs, social security authorities, the 
labor authority and credit  institutions are notified of the commencement of 
liquidation proceedings by the court carrying out the proceedings.  
Certain special rules apply to  bankruptcy and involuntary liquidation procedures 
against economic organizations of high strategic importance.  
4.9 Bankruptcy  
The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to make arrangements for the settlement 
of creditors’ claims against the debtor. Bankruptcy proceedings are voluntary 
proceedings which either precede or avert liquidation proceedings. A managing 
director of the deb tor is generally entitled to file an application for bankruptcy 
with the competent court at any time via their legal representative  on a separated 
form deteremined by special acts  (from the 1st of January 201 5 this can only be 
initiated by  way of an e lectronic form), depending on the financial status of the 
debtor. A restriction is that the debtor may not declare bankruptcy within 2 years 
of the announcement of the end of its previous bankruptcy, if there are still unpaid 
creditor claims from the previous b ankruptcy.  
 
  
86  
4.10 Liquidation Proceedings  
The purpose of liquidation proceedings is to provide satisfaction to creditors for 
the debt of insolvent debtors at the moment of dissolution and the termination of 
corporate existence pursuant to the Act. A “debtor” is the entity unable to pay its 
debt when due or presumably will not be able to pay its debt when the debts 
become due. Before the commencement of the liquidation, a “creditor” is a person 
who has an overdue claim against the debtor based on a fin al and enforceable 
court ruling or administrative decision, or based on some other (e. g. notarial) 
enforceable deed, or has an overdue claim which is not disputed or has been 
acknowledged by the debtor. Certain special rules apply to bankruptcy and 
involu ntary liquidation procedures against economic organizations of high 
strategic importance.  
4.11 Initiating liquidation proceedings  
Creditors (and the debtor, receiver or, at special conditions, a court) may request 
the court to initiate liquidation proceedings  against a debtor. At the request of the 
creditor, the court examines whether the debtor is insolvent. The request of the 
creditor must specify the origin of the debt, the due date and a summary of the 
reasons for which the debtor is insolvent. The credito r may refer to the following 
reasons of insolvency:  
(a) The debtor’s failure to settle or contest his previously undisputed or 
acknowledged contractual debts within twenty days of the due date, and 
failure to satisfy such debt upon receipt of the creditor’s subsequent 
written payment notice; or  
(b) the debtor’s failure to settle its debt within the deadline specified in a 
final and binding court decision; or  
(c) the court enforcement procedure against the debtor was unsuccessful; or  
(d) the debtor did not fulfill  its payment obligation as stipulated in the 
composition agreement.  
The documents supporting the claim must be attached, including a copy  of the 
written  payment notice sent to the debtor.  
If the court finds the debtor insolvent based on any of the above reasons, then it 
orders the liquidation of the debtor by an order within 60 days after the receipt of 
the request for the liquidation proceedings. The court must notify the debtor about 
the liquidation request of the creditor by sending a copy of the request. As a 
response, the debtor declares whether it acknowledged the contents of the petition 
within 8 days from the notification. If the debtor acknowledges the claim, he must 
also simultaneo usly declare whether he wishes to require time to settle the debts.  
The court examines the solvency of the debtor upon receipt of a petition for or 
notice of liquidation and may, at the request of the debtor, grant a 45 day grace 
period to such debtor for  repayment of its debt(s).  
87  
 
 
The court will terminate the liquidation proceedings effective immediately if it can 
be established that the debtor is solvent.  
The court orders the appointment of a liquidator when insolvency of the debtor is 
established. The court order is published in the Official Company Gazette; the 
court, in the frame of the court order, calls upon creditors to submit their claims to 
the liquidator within 40 days.  
The most important legal consequences of the opening of the liquidation  
procedure are the following:  
 The rights of the owner of the debtor legal entity shall cease when the 
liquidation procedure begins and only the liquidator is authorized to 
make any legal statements in connection with the debtor’s assets.  
 The name of the debtor company shall be appended by the words under 
liquidation or by the abbreviation “f. a.”.  
 All debts of the debtor company become due.  
 Any judicial enforcement proceedings in progress against the debtor in 
connection with the assets under the liquidation shall be stopped by the 
court.  
 After the starting date of the liquidation, any claim against the debtor in 
connection with the assets covered under liquidation can be enforced 
only in the framework of the liquidation.  
4.12 Temporary administrator  
The creditor may request the court to appoint a temporary administrator, from the 
register of liquidators, to supervise the debtors’ financial management during the 
procedure. The requirements of appointing a temporary administrator are the 
following: (a)  evidence that the subsequent satisfaction of the claim at a later date 
is endangered; (b) the amount of the claim and its expiry can be proven  by a 
public document or a priva te document with full probative force; (c) the creditor 
advances the fee of the temporary administrator (HUF 200,000 if the debtor has no 
legal personality and HUF 400,000 for legal person debtors; equaling 
approximately EUR 670 and 1,340) and deposits the fee at  the time of the 
submission of the request.  
The temporary administrator has the power to monitor the debtor’s business 
activities to protect creditor’s interests, and reviews the debtor’s financial 
situation. The managers of the debtor company are required to cooperate with the 
temporary administrat or and to provide assistance. If the managers of the debtor 
company violate seriously and repeatedly their obligations to cooperate, the court 
can order the company’s liquidation immediately, irrespective of whether the 
debtor is declared insolvent or not.  This order may be executed irrespective of any 
appeal. The term of the temporary administrator ends when the liquidation 
proceedings begin or when the liquidation proceedings are concluded.  
   
88  
The signatory rights of a debtor’s executive officer or other entitled person in 
liquidation terminate on the official commencement date of the liquidation. 
Following such date, any undertakings  and signatures on behalf of the debtor may 
only be given by t he liquidator.  
4.13 Simplified liquidation  
If the assets of the debtor would not cover the costs of the liquidation procedure, 
or the liquidation may not proceed due to inadequate books and records of the 
debtor, upon the request of the liquidator, the court will order a simplified 
liquidation. In most of such cases the assets are not enough to satisfy the costs of 
the procedure.  
4.14 The role of the liquidator in the liquidation proceedings  
The appointed liquidator acts on behalf of the debtor and may not assign the 
execution of liquidation proceedings to any other parties, the liquidator also 
analyzes the financial standing of the debtor, subsequent to which the liquidator 
opens a liquidatio n account, estimates the costs of liquidation and sets up a 
timetable for its implementation. The liquidator keeps separate records about the 
claims reported within 40 days from the publication of order to liquidate and 
about the claims reported after the 40 day period but within 180 days from the 
publication of order to liquidate. The time of the notification has an effect on the 
sequence and/or ratio of satisfaction of the claims. The liquidator decides the 
reported claims in 45 days from the last day of the notification period. If the 
liquidator disputes the claim reported by a creditor, upon the creditor’s request the 
court decides the validity of the creditor’s alleged claim.  
The liquidator must convene all the registered creditors, within 75 days foll owing 
the date of publication of the opening of liquidation , to establish the creditors’ 
committee. The liquidator sends a settlement of account and a report on 
liquidation expenses to the creditor’s committee every three months.  
Upon the commencement of the liquidation proceedings, employment  rights over 
the employees of the debtor are exercised by the liquidator.  
The liquidator has the power to terminate the contracts concluded by the debtor with 
immediate effect, or if none of the parties performed any services, the liquidator may 
withdraw from the contract. The liquidator shall collect the claims of the debtor 
when due, enforce its claims and sell its assets. In the process of the liquidation, the 
liquidator provides protection  and safeguard for the debtor’s assets.  
 
  
89 If the amount of money received during the liquidation procedure is sufficient to 
cover the claims of creditors, the liquidator may prepare an interim liquidation 
account after the deadline of the notification claims. Provisions shall be made to 
cover the expected liquidation expenses and the disputed creditor’s claims on the 
basis of the interim account. The interim account shall be presented to the court 
for approval and the opinion of the creditors committee shall be attached as well. 
The court shall approve or refuse the interim account and the proposal for partial 
distribution of the assets within 30 days. In such case the liquidator satisfies the 
claims on basis of the interim account approved by the court and also informs all 
creditors of the debtor about the exact amount of the payment.  
At the end of the liquidation proceedings, the liquidator prepares the final 
liquidation balance sheet, the statement of the revenues and expenditures, the final 
tax retur ns and sends all these documents to the court and to the tax authorities.  
The final balance sheet must be prepared within 2 year from the time of opening 
of the liquidation proceedings.  
4.15 Settlement Agreement in the course of liquidation  
The liquidation p roceedings may be concluded by the dissolution of the debtor or 
by a settlement. The settlement can take place 40 days after publication of the 
order ordering the liquidation . Only those creditors who reported their claim in 
conformity with the regulations  can participate in the settlement negotiations. The 
creditors and the debtor can conclude a settlement before the final liquidation 
balance sheet is submitted.  Those who did not register as creditors in the 
liquidation proceedings may not enforce their c laim if and after a settlement is 
made.   
During the negotiations between the debtor and the creditors within 60 days 
following the request of the debtor, the debtor presents a program suitable for the 
restoration of solvency and a settlement proposal, as well as the list of creditors. 
During the negotiations, the company under liquidation and the creditors may 
agree on (a) the order for the settlements of debts (b) reschedule of the payments 
(c) the ratio and the manner of satisfaction of debts and (d) any other questions 
that are deemed essential  by the parties for the purpose of restoring the debtor’s 
solvency. If the solvency of the company is restored through the settlement and 
the settlement conforms to the law then the court approves it by an order.  
 
  
90 13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION  
4.16 Sources of law  
Hungary is a civil law jurisdiction. The main sources of law are the “Fundamental 
Act of Hungary”, the acts of the Parliament, and the governmental, ministerial and 
municipal decrees. The Constitutional Court has a certain authorization to review 
the cons titutionality of Hungarian legislation.  
Since Hungary’s accession to the European Union on 1 May 2004, European  law 
also form part of the Hungarian legal system.  
Judicial precedents are generally not binding.  
4.17 State Courts  
Hungary has a four -tier court system, which include the circle (in Budapest, the  
district ) courts, the tribunals (organized at a county level and in Budapest ), the 
Appellate Courts and the Curia (formerly known as the ‘supreme Court”). There 
are separate  courts, organized at a county level, to hear administrative and 
employment matters at the first instance.  
In most of the cases, the circle courts, including the district courts operating in 
Budapest , are the courts proceeding on the  first instance. They  deal with any 
commercial matter except those delegated to the tribunals that may also proceed as 
the court of first instance.  
There are twenty tribunals in Hungary: one in each of the 19 counties and an 
additional one in Budapest (the latter is called th e Metropolitan Tribunal). The 
tribunals hear appeals from jud gments of the lower Courts, and also act as courts 
of first instance in certain matters, among others in commercial disputes where the 
amount in controversy exceeds HUF 30 Million (approximately EUR 100,000).  
Separate divisions of the tribunals act as Courts of Registration and are 
responsible for the trade registry records of corporations registered  in Hungary.  
There are five Appellate Courts in the country, which hear appeals tribunals.  
An important task of the Curia is to develop the jurisprudence of the Hungarian 
courts. The Curia has exclusive jurisdiction for extraordinary judicial review. The 
Curia also hears appeals from certain decisions of the Appellate Courts and, in 
limited cases, from the tribunals.  
4.18 Arbitration  
The Hungarian  Arbitration Act regulates both domestic and international 
arbitrations in Hungary. The Hungarian Arbitration Act is based on the 
UNCITRAL  Model Law. The most widely known Hungarian permanent 
arbitration court is the permanent Arbitration Court attached to the Hungarian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. No appeal is allowed against arbitral awards. 
However, state courts are allowed to cancel  arbitral awards on certain, very 
limited grounds.

Every two years, the fDI magazine announces its ranking entitled "European Cities & 
Regions of the Future" which aims to collect and rank the most important investment sites. 
This year, in addition to Budapest, Hungarian  rural locations also have been placed on the 
magazine's list of the top ten. According to the ranking Budapest is still among the most 
attractive cities on the list of the top ten cities in Eastern Europe and is on the list of the top 
ten most important E uropean cities in three subcategories as well. Further significant success 
is that, in addition to Budapest, for the first time another Hungarian town achieved a 
ranking: "Győr ranked ninth among the “Top 10 Small European Cities of the Future 
2016/17 – Business Friendliness”. In addition, the Central Hungary region ended up among 
the top 10 in as many as two categories: it is the fourth among the “Top 10 Mid -Sized 
European Regions of the Future 2016/17 – Business Friendliness”, while Transdanubia 
region re ached tenth on this ranking. Among the “Top 10 Eastern European Regions of the 
Future 2016/17”, on the whole, Central Hungary ranks seventh, which is an important 
achievement.

 With a view to responding to new economic challenges, 
the Hungarian Government decided to transform its 
economic policy and place more emphasis on foreign 
economy in 2014.  
 
As a result of the structural changes, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade ( KKM) has become one of 
the most powerful Hungarian ministries, which gives 
priority to foreign economy. The relevant institutions 
were also transformed, and the Hungarian Investment 
Promotion Agency (HIPA) was established as the 
successor of the Hungarian Investment and Trade 
Agency.  
 
The professional investment promotion organization 
thus created will, as the background institution of KKM, 
give even more concentrated assistance for the 
Hungarian investments of international companies.

Budapest in 2001 where he studied Business

as a Regional Finance Director in Austria and as 
Finance Director of the Comm unications Division in

NATIONAL AVOWAL  
WE, THE MEMBERS OF THE HUNGARIAN NATION, at the beginning of the new 
millennium, with a sense of responsibility for every Hungarian, hereby proclaim the 
following:  
We are proud that our king Saint Stephen built the Hungarian State on solid ground and 
made our country a part of Christian Europe one thousand years ago.  
We are proud of our forebears who fought for the survival, freedom and independence of 
our country.  
We are p roud of the outstanding intellectual achievements of the Hungarian people.  
We are proud that our nation has over the centuries defended Europe in a series of struggles 
and enriched Europe’s common values with its talent and diligence.  
We recognise the role  of Christianity in preserving nationhood. We value the various 
religious traditions of our country.  
We promise to preserve  our nation’s intellectual and spiritual unity , torn apart in the storms 
of the last century.  
We proclaim that the national minori ties living with us form part of the Hungarian political 
community and are constituent parts of the State.  
We commit ourselves to promoting and safeguarding our heritage, our unique language, 
Hungarian culture  and the languages and cultures of national  minorities living in Hungary, 
along with all man -made and natural assets of the Carpathian Basin. We bear responsibility 
for our descendants  and therefore we shall protect the living conditions of future generations 
by making prudent use of our material, inte llectual and natural resources.  
We believe that our national culture is a rich contribution to the diversity of European unity.  
We respect the freedom and culture of other nations, and shall strive to cooperate with all 
nations of the world.  
We hold that h uman existence is based on human dignity.  
We hold that individual freedom can only be complete in cooperation with others.  
We hold that the family and the nation constitute the principal framework of our 
coexistence, and that our fundamental cohesive values are loyalty , faith and love.  
We hold that the strength of a community and the honour of each person are based on 
labour  and the  achievement of the human mind.  
We hold that we have a general duty to help the vulnerable and the poor.  
We hold that the common goal of citizens and the State is to achieve the highest possible 
measure of well -being, safety, order, justice and liber ty. 
We hold that democracy is only possible where the State serves its citizens and handles their 
affairs in an equitable manner, without abuse  and impartially . 
We honour the achievements of our historic constitution and we honour the Holy Crown, 
which embodies the constitutional continuity of Hungary’s statehood and the unity of the 
nation.  
We hold that the protection of our identity rooted in our historic constitution is a 
fundamental obligation of the State.

Contact: eu-forditas@im.gov.hu  We do not recognise the suspension of our h istoric constitution due to foreign occupations. 
We deny any statute of limitations for the inhuman crimes committed against the Hungarian 
nation and its citizens under the national socialist and the communist dictatorship.  
We do not recognise the communis t constitution of 1949, since it was the basis for 
tyrannical rule; we therefore proclaim it to be invalid.  
We agree with the Members of the first free National Assembly, which proclaimed as its 
first decision that our current liberty was born of our 1956 Revolution.  
We date the restoration of our country’s self -determination, lost on the nineteenth day of 
March 1944, from the second day of May 1990, when the first freely elected organ of popular 
representation was formed. We shall consider this date to be the beginning of our country’s 
new democracy and constitutional order.  
We hold that after the decades of the twentieth century, which led to a state of moral decay, 
we have an abiding need for spiritual and intellectual renewal.  
We trust in a jointly -shape d future and the commitment of younger generations. We believe 
that our children and grandchildren will make Hungary great again with their talent, 
persistence and moral strength.  
Our Fundamental Law shall be the basis of our legal order; it shall be an al liance among 
Hungarians of the past, present and future. It is a living framework which expresses the 
nation’s will and the form in which we want to live.  
We, the citizens of Hungary, are ready to found the order of our country upon the common 
endeavours o f the nation.

2 BUSINESS ENTITIES 
 
2.1 Forms of business entities 
 
2.1.1 Introduction 
 
In July 2006, a new Companies Act (Act IV of 2006 o n Companies – “Companies Act”) and 
a new Registration Act (Act V of 2006 on Public Com pany Information, Court Registration 
Proceedings and Dissolution Procedures – “Registrat ion Act”) came into effect. 
 
The Companies Act provides for a variety of legal f orms under which business entities may 
be established in Hungary. 
 
Pursuant to the Companies Act, these forms are: 
• unlimited partnership (Kkt) 
• limited partnership (Bt) 
• limited liability company (Kft) 
• company limited by shares (Rt), which may be privat ely founded (Zrt) or publicly 
founded (Nyrt) 
Companies duly formed and registered under Hungaria n law may undertake obligations and 
acquire rights in their own name (i.e. they have th e right to acquire property, may conclude 
contracts, file lawsuits or be subject to actions b rought against them). As a general rule, 
companies may freely pursue activities; however, a license of the competent authority is 
required for certain activities. Companies with for eign participation may be established in any 
business entity form without an authority license o r permission. 
 
2.1.2 Unlimited partnership (Kkt ) 
 
In an unlimited partnership, the liabilities of its  members are joint and unlimited for the 
partnership’s obligations. No minimum initial capit al requirement is set forth by law and its 
members are not required to take part personally in  the activities of the partnership. By law,

2.1.4 Limited liability company (Kft)

to the provision of the company’s initial capital ( and, if so stated in the articles of association, 
other contributions). As a general rule, members ar e not otherwise responsible for the 
company’s liabilities. A Kft’s members may not be r ecruited through public offerings. The 
members’ rights and their title to the company’s as sets are represented by quotas in the 
company. No securities may be issued in respect of the quotas, which may be (i) ordinary 
quotas (quotas providing identical membership right s) or alternatively (ii) preferred quotas

2.1.6 Differences between a Kft and an Rt 
 
Pursuant to the Companies Act, the following are th e basic differences between a Kft and an 
Rt: 
• Management 
Kft: one or more managing directors manage the comp any  
Rt: a board of directors composed of three to eleve n members or, if the constitutive 
document so provides, the general director, manages  the company 
• Recruitment of members through public offerings 
 Kft:  forbidden  
Rt: other than a private Rt, the company may public ly advertise the sale of its shares 
• Required minimum initial capital 
 Kft: HUF 500,000 (EUR 1,785); Kfts may be establis hed without cash contributions 
and only in-kind contributions  
Private Rt: HUF 5 million (EUR 17,850); private Rts  may be established without cash 
contributions and only in-kind contributions 
Public Rt: HUF 20 million (EUR 71,400); public Rts may not be established without 
cash contributions 
• Supervisory board  
General: The board must have three to fifteen membe rs. If the annual average number 
of the company’s full-time employees exceeds 200, t hen employees must make up 
one-third of the supervisory board. All companies m ust have a supervisory board if 
(i) the law so requests in order to protect public property or with respect to the 
activities pursued by the company, or (ii) the annu al average number of full-time 
employees exceeds 200. 
Kft: not required (apart from the above mandatory c ases)  
Private Rt:  only if shareholders representing at l east 5% of the voting rights so 
request (as well as the above mandatory cases)  
Public Rt: mandatory except for public Rts operatin g under the so-called unified 
company management system 
• Auditor 
Kft: not mandatory, except if (i) the Accounting Ac t so requires, (ii) the company’s 
articles of association so prescribe, or (iii) the law so prescribes in order to protect 
public property  
• Quotas/shares 
Kft: each quotaholder may have only one quota. If a  quotaholder acquires another 
quota, its quota will be increased by the one it ac quired, and as a result, the 
quotaholder will still only have one quota but with  a higher value. Quotas may be 
freely transferred between members of the company. The members may give pre-
emption rights to each other in the company’s artic les of association. By law, with 
respect to a quota intended to be transferred throu gh a sale and purchase contract, the 
other member(s), the company, or a third person so designated by the quotaholders’ 
meeting, in this order, have pre-emption rights, un less this is excluded (or restricted) 
under the articles of association. The articles of association may restrict, set 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 6 conditions or prescribe the need for the company’s consent for the transfer of quotas 
to third persons. 
Rt: only registered shares may be issued. Unless ot herwise provided by law, shares 
are freely transferable. However, a private Rt’s co nstitutive document may restrict the 
transfer of shares or may render it subject to the company’s consent. The transfer of 
registered shares is valid with respect to an Rt an d shareholders may exercise their 
shareholders’ rights with respect to the company on ly if such shareholders have been 
registered in the book of shareholders. Unlike the quotas of a Kft or the shares of a 
private Rt, a public Rt’s shares may be traded on t he stock exchange. 
• Securities 
Kft: printed securities representing the quotas may  not be issued 
Rt: securities representing the shares may be issue d (private Rts: printed share 
certificates or dematerialized shares, public Rts: only dematerialized shares)  
 
2.2 Establishing companies 
 
2.2.1 Introduction 
 
The founders of a company must first sign the compa ny’s constitutive document, after which 
an attorney-at-law (a member of the Hungarian bar) must countersign and file it with the 
competent Court of Registration. Technically and le gally it is the court’s act of registration 
that creates the company. A company’s fundamental c orporate data (i.e. its name, 
headquarters, members’ names, addresses/seats, main  activity, initial capital, members’ 
contributions, the method and timing of providing t he initial capital, method of representation 
and signature rights, the names and addresses of th e executive officers, supervisory board 
members and the auditor etc.) and its internal regu lations are set forth in its constitutive 
document, i.e. (i) articles of association, (ii) de ed of foundation, or (iii) statutes. 
 
Only Kfts and private Rts may be one-member compani es; other business entity forms must 
have at least two members.  
 
2.2.2 Pre-company 
 
Between the execution of the constitutive document and the court's act of registration, the 
company exists as a pre-company. A pre-company can only pursue a limited number of 
activities. 
 
2.2.3 Registration fees 
 
The duty levied for the registration of a: 
• public Rt is HUF 600,000 (EUR 2,142) 
• private Rt is HUF 100,000 (EUR 357) 
• Kft is HUF 100,000 (EUR 357) 
• Kkt or a Bt is HUF 50,000 (EUR 178) 
A notice on the establishment of a business entity must be published in the official 
companies’ gazette (Cégközlöny), which entails a no minal publication fee. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 7 Companies only have to pay once for their registrat ion (i.e. there are no further payments to 
the courts to keep their registered data in the Com panies Register), as long as their registered 
data remains unchanged. However, almost any amendme nt to the company’s data must be 
registered in the Companies Register, which entails  the payment of additional nominal duty. 
 
2.2.4 Registration 
 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Registration Act,  the establishment of a company must be 
reported to the competent Court of Registration wit hin 30 days of signing (or in the case of a 
public Rt, accepting) the constitutive document. 
 
All filings with the Court of Registration must be done digitally (in an e-mail message) by an 
attorney-at-law, with such legal representation by an attorney being mandatory. Scanned 
copies of the duly executed corporate documents mus t be enclosed with the request and the e-
mail message must be endorsed with the filing attor ney-at-law’s certified digital signature and 
also with a time stamp. 
 
Except for public Rts, all business entities may be  established by filling out a template (the 
template is determined by law), which will be their  constitutive document. In such cases the 
Court of Registration must register the establishme nt of the entity/changes in the corporate 
data within one working hour of filing the request during court opening hours (assuming the 
request and all related documents are faultless). 
 
For entities not using the official template as the ir constitutive document, the competent Court 
of Registration must carry out the registration pro cedure within 15 days of filing the request 
(assuming the request and all related documents are  present and correct). 
 
The headings pertaining to the Companies Register ( the indication of the data registered) may 
also be displayed in English, German, French and Ru ssian. Furthermore, all corporate 
documents may be registered in any of the official languages of the EU provided that an 
official translation is enclosed for all the corpor ate documents which are filed. 
 
2.3 Management of companies 
 
2.3.1 Management 
 
The executive officers of a company provide for the  company’s management and day-to-day 
operation; by law, as a general rule, they may be e lected for a definite period of time of a 
maximum of five years or, if the company’s constitu tive document specifically allows, for an 
indefinite period of time.  
 
The executive officer(s) is/are called: 
• managing director(s)  (Kft)  
• members of the board of directors (Rt) (or in the c ase of private Rts, a general 
director may be elected)  
• member(s) entitled to carry out the management  (Kk t) 
• general partner(s) (Bt) 
In the course of their management activities, execu tive officers must act with the 
responsibility generally expected of persons holdin g such positions. Executive officers will be 
liable for any damage incurred by their company due  to their negligent or intentional breach 
of the above duty. Detailed rules apply in respect of the non-compatibility of executive 
officers. 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 8  
Since the executive officers represent the company,  the company is directly liable for any 
damage caused by executive officers in relation to third parties. However, the company may 
then bring indemnification claims against the execu tive officers for such damage. 
 
Following the occurrence of a situation which threa tens the company with insolvency, the 
executive officers must conduct their managing duti es based on the priority of the interests of 
the creditors of the company. During liquidation pr oceedings any creditor or the liquidator 
may request the competent court to establish that t he persons who were executive officers of 
the company during the three-year period immediatel y preceding the commencement date of 
the liquidation proceedings, failed to conduct thei r managing duties on the basis of the 
priority of the interests of the creditors after th e occurrence of any situation threatening the 
company with insolvency, and, as a consequence of w hich, the assets of the company have 
been diminished to the extent specified in the requ est. 
 
In the case where a company is terminated without a  legal successor, anyone who is a 
member (shareholder) at the time of the company’s t ermination may sue its company’s former 
executive officers for damages. Such claims must be  filed within one year of the company’s 
termination. In the case where the liability of the  member (shareholder) for the company’s 
obligations was limited while the company existed, such member may claim damages as 
above only to the extent proportionate to the part of the company’s assets that was due to 
it/him when the company was terminated. 
 
2.3.2 Supervisory board 
 
The formation of a supervisory board is mandatory f or: 
• public Rts (except if the company operates pursuant  to a special regime called the 
unified company management system) 
• private Rts, only if shareholders representing at l east 5% of the voting rights so 
request 
• any company, irrespective of its form and its metho d of operation, if the law so 
prescribes in order to protect public property or w ith respect to the activities pursued 
by the company 
• all companies employing an annual average of 200 fu ll-time employees 
The basic role of the supervisory board is the supe rvision of management activities; 
furthermore, a private Rt’s or Kft’s constitutive d ocument may authorize the supervisory 
board to: (i) appoint and remove members of the boa rd of directors or the managing director, 
(ii) establish the remuneration of members of the b oard of directors or the managing director, 
and/or (iii) give its prior consent to the passing of certain major resolutions. 
 
If, acting within the special competence transferre d to it, the supervisory board has refused to 
give its consent to a resolution, the managing dire ctor or the board of directors is entitled to 
convene the quotaholders’/shareholders’ meeting, wh ich is the corporate body entitled to 
change the resolution of the supervisory board. For  any damage caused to the company by 
resolutions made within the above powers of the sup ervisory board, its members and the 
executive officers will have joint and several liab ility vis-à-vis the company. 
 
2.3.3 Auditor 
 
By law, an auditor must be elected: 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 9 • if the Accounting Act requires a company (e.g. the company has double-entry 
bookkeeping, and its annual net sales revenue, calc ulated on the basis of its preceding 
two business years’ average sales revenue, exceeds HUF 100,000,000 (EUR 
357,000)) 
• if the constitutive document of the company so pres cribes 
• if the law so prescribes for the protection of publ ic property 
2.4 Novelties of corporate law 
 
The following list contains some recent corporate l aw amendments with possible significance 
from a practical perspective: 
• law firms may provide certain company secretary ser vices 
• the person entitled to represent the company may ex ercise his/her right in e-mails by 
using his/her digital signature 
• the company may publish some of its mandatory annou ncements on its website (as 
opposed to in the official companies’ gazette (Cégk özlöny)) 
• the headings of the Companies Register (the indicat ion of the data registered therein) 
may be displayed in English, German, French and Rus sian 
• the company may determine the date of effectiveness  of the change of its corporate 
data, (i.e. it may be subsequent to the day when su ch change was decided upon) 
• the appointment of a delivery agent (for persons/en tities having no address/seat in 
Hungary) is optional (however, it is advisable to d o so) 
• anyone having an address/seat in Hungary may be a d elivery agent (as opposed to the 
former significant restrictions effective prior to September 1, 2007) 
• mortgages over quotas may (and must) be registered in the Companies Register 
• members of companies, except for public Rts, may de cide on all corporate matters 
without holding a meeting (e.g. in writing) providi ng that the company’s constitutive 
document so provides 
• executive officers may perform their duties under a n employment contract (as 
opposed to a special agency agreement) 
• filings with the Court of Registration, in their en tirety, may only be done digitally 
• Kfts may be established with HUF 500,000 initial ca pital (EUR 1,785 – as opposed to 
HUF 3 million (EUR 10,700) formerly) 
• private Rts may be established with HUF 5 million ( EUR 17,850, as opposed to HUF 
20 million (EUR 71,400) formerly, which is still th e requirement for public Rts) 
Please note that the above list is far from exhaust ive. For details or specific advice in

2.5 Pursuing business activities in a non-corporate  form 
 
2.5.1 Introduction 
 
A foreign investor may decide to establish a presen ce in Hungary as a foreign private 
entrepreneur, through a commercial agent, as a comm ercial representative office or branch of 
a foreign company. 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 10  
2.5.2 Foreign private entrepreneurs 
 
Pursuant to Act LXXII of 1998 on Foreign Private En trepreneurs, a foreign investor may 
carry out business activities as a private entrepre neur provided that an international treaty 
expressly ensures national treatment for him or her . The foreign private entrepreneur is 
deemed to be a foreign exchange resident unless leg al rules regarding foreign exchange 
provide otherwise. For the purpose of the applicati on of the legal rules related to the 
acquisition of real property, the foreign private e ntrepreneur is deemed to be a foreign natural 
person. 
 
2.5.3 Commercial agent 
 
A foreign investor may also carry on business activ ities if it contracts a “commercial agent” 
according to the stipulations of Act CXVII of 2000 on the Commercial Representation 
Contracts of Independent Commercial Agents (Commerc ial Agency Act). Its provisions are 
harmonized with the Council Directive on self-emplo yed commercial agents (86/653/EEC). 
 
The Commercial Agency Act uses the term “commercial  agent” in the broadest sense. For the 
purpose of the Commercial Agency Act, an entity is deemed to be a “commercial agent” if it 
mediates transactions for its principal on the basi s of a permanent contractual relationship for 
an agreed fee. This includes any such entity which is entitled to conclude agreements related 
to the principal’s goods in its own name for the be nefit of the principal. 
 
The Commercial Agency Act applies to agreements con cluded with independent “commercial 
agents” who pursue commercial activities at their o wn risk. 
 
According to the Commercial Agency Act, should an e ntity qualify as a “commercial agent,” 
certain mandatory provisions of Hungarian law have to be applied to the commercial agency 
agreement. For example, the agent should be entitle d to compensation if it has brought the 
principal new customers and the principal continues  to derive substantial benefits from such 
customers even after the termination of the agency relationship provided that the 
compensation payment is equitable with regard to al l the circumstances. 
 
2.5.4 Commercial representative office 
 
According to Act CXXXII of 1997 on Hungarian Branch es and Commercial Representative 
Offices of Foreign-Registered Companies (Branches A ct), a commercial representative office 
is an organizational unit of a foreign enterprise h aving no separate legal entity. Foreign firms 
may establish commercial representative offices. A commercial representative office may 
start its activity after the competent Court of Reg istration has registered it. A commercial 
representative office may be entered in the Compani es Register if the application for 
registration and its appendices conform to the requ irements prescribed by the Branches Act 
and the Registration Act. 
 
Only employees and persons seconded to the commerci al representative office or persons 
who have a Hungarian domicile and a permanent servi ces agreement to work at the 
commercial representative office may represent the commercial representative office. 
However, since Hungary’s EU accession, this rule do es not apply to commercial 
representative offices established by foreign compa nies registered in the European Economic 
Area. 
 
A commercial representative office’s activities are  restricted to: 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 11 • mediating contracts between the foreign firm and Hu ngarian business organizations 
or private individuals. 
• participating in preparing contracts as described a bove. 
• concluding contracts required for the operation of the commercial representative 
office for and on behalf of the foreign firm. 
• performing informational and promotional activities  related to goods, services and 
rights marketed by the represented foreign company,  including organizing the foreign 
company’s participation in exhibitions, fairs, prof essional lectures and other similar 
events held in Hungary. 
In contrast to branches, commercial representative offices may not conduct entrepreneurial 
activities. 
 
2.5.5 Branch of a foreign company 
 
A branch is an organizational unit of a foreign ent erprise having no separate legal entity. 
However, the foreign enterprise is authorized to pu rsue business activities through its branch. 
The branch cannot perform representative activities  on behalf of the founding foreign 
company. 
 
The law considers the branch to be a relatively ind ependent part of the foreign company, and 
specifies that the foreign company must continuousl y provide the assets needed for the 
operation of the branch, and to settle its debts. T he foreign founder and the branch will bear 
joint and several, unlimited liability for debts in curred in the course of the activities of the 
branch. With respect to debts incurred in connectio n with activities pursued via the branch, 
execution may be levied over all the foreign compan y’s assets located in Hungary. 
 
The branch comes into existence and may start its o perations when it is registered by the 
Court of Registration. However, in the case of bran ches of foreign companies having their 
seat in the European Economic Area, as of Hungary’s  accession to the European Union, it is 
possible for persons who are entitled to sign on be half of the branch, to act in the name of and 
on behalf of the branch after filing the applicatio n for registration. However, the term “under 
registration” must be indicated on documents and du ring transactions. 
 
It is not possible for the branch “under registrati on” to pursue activities that are subject to an 
authority license. If the branch’s application for registration is rejected, it may not acquire 
further rights nor undertake further obligations an d must promptly terminate its operations. 
The foreign founder will bear unlimited liability f or debts incurred as a result of the 
obligations of the branch. 
 
If, in connection with the performance of a particu lar activity, a license is required for 
founding a company or for the performance of a spec ific activity by a company, this license 
must also be obtained by the branch for its establi shment or for the performance of this 
activity. For a specific activity, in order to prot ect the interests of clients, consumers or 
business partners, separate financial guarantees ma y also be required by law, and such 
requirements must also be met by the branch and com panies as well. Since Hungary’s EU 
accession, statutory provisions may provide that a company established in the European 
Economic Area may - by way of its Hungarian branch - engage in activities subject to a 
foundation or operational license also if it is its elf equipped with such a license from the 
competent authority of its home country, or may pro vide that the foreign company may 
satisfy the above requirements. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 12 A branch may be entered in the Companies Register i f the application for registration and its 
appendices conform to the requirements prescribed b y the Branches Act and the Registration 
Act. 
 
Only employees and persons seconded to the branch, or persons who have a Hungarian 
domicile and a permanent services agreement to work  at the branch, may represent the 
branch. However, since Hungary’s EU accession, this  rule does not apply to branches 
established by foreign companies registered in the European Economic Area. The Branches 
Act sets forth certain incompatibility rules for pr ivate person representatives of branches. 
 
The branch is obliged to appoint a statutory audito r. However, since Hungary’s EU accession, 
in the case of branches established by foreign comp anies registered in the European 
Economic Area, the branch is not obliged to appoint  a statutory auditor provided that the 
foreign company’s annual report has been prepared a nd audited in accordance with the 
relevant directives of the European Union and that the branch has published and deposited the 
foreign company’s annual report in Hungarian. 
 
The amount of capital available for the operation o f the branch must be indicated in 
Hungarian Forint (HUF). Changes in the branch’s cap ital must be reported to the Court of 
Registration, for registration and publication, at least once every year. 
 
2.6 Mergers and acquisitions 
 
2.6.1 Mergers 
 
Under the Companies Act, a company’s assets and lia bilities may be transferred to another 
company and a new company (legal successor) may be established with the assets of the 
existing company through transformation. According to the provisions of the Companies Act, 
the merger of two or more companies and the de-merg er of a company can accomplish 
transformation. 
 
A merger is a way of amalgamating the assets or lia bilities, and the activities of two or more 
companies. According to the Companies Act, there ar e two kinds of mergers, whereby: 
• A company ceases to exist and all of its property i s transferred to another existing 
company which is deemed the legal successor of the fused company in all respects. 
• Two or more existing companies cease to exist and a ll of their property is transferred 
to a new company established through a merger, whic h is deemed the legal successor 
of the fused companies in all respects. 
A de-merger is a way of splitting the assets or lia bilities and business lines of one company. 
The Companies Act contains two methods of de-merger  whereby: 
• The original company ceases to exist and two or mor e separate and new independent 
companies come into existence with the assets of th e original company. The new 
companies become the legal successors of the termin ated original company (division 
de-merger). 
• The original company remains in existence and conti nues to operate in its previous 
corporate form. One or more new companies are creat ed by the members de-merging 
from the original company with certain parts of the  assets of the original company. 
The new companies will be the legal successors of t he original company based on the 
provisions of the de-merger agreement, unless the C ompanies Act states otherwise 
(separation de-merger). 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 13 2.6.2 Acquisitions 
 
In the case of acquisitions, the aim to concentrate  capital and/or business lines and/or 
strengthen the business position can be achieved by : 
• having shares/quotas  
• holding voting or other rights (e.g. the right to e lect persons having key roles in the 
management of the target company) 
• using the assets 
• having other forms of influence 
The Companies Act contains obligations imposed not only on Kfts or private Rts, but directly 
on the party acquiring the quotas/shares in them, f or reporting a take-over if it exceeds a 
certain threshold (at least 75% of the direct or in direct votes, the latter of which is defined in 
the Hungarian Civil Code). Furthermore, provided th at the articles of association do not 
exclude this, any minority quotaholders/shareholder s of the controlled company may request 
(within 60 days from the publication of the take-ov er) that the dominant member purchase 
their shares. 
 
The Companies Act introduced a new legal concept as  of July 1, 2006; namely, a recognized 
group of companies. Any company which is required t o draw up consolidated annual reports 
according to the Accounting Act (dominant member) a nd any public or private Rt, or Kft, 
over which the dominant member effectively exercise s a dominant influence according to the 
Accounting Act (controlled company) may decide to e nter into a control contract to join 
forces in pursuing their common business interests and continue operating in the form of a 
recognized group of companies. Having a recognized group of companies registered in the 
Companies Register will not result in creating a se parate legal entity from the companies 
belonging to the recognized group. The dominant mem ber must notify the creditors of any of 
the companies in the recognized group by an announc ement to be published twice in the 
official companies’ gazette (Cégközlöny). The membe rs of a controlled Kft or shareholders of 
a private Rt which participate in setting up the re cognized group may request that their 
quotas/shares be purchased by the dominant member. The Companies Act contains further 
stipulations that are applicable to recognized grou ps of companies. 
 
Act CXX of 2001 on Capital Markets (the Capital Mar kets Act) contains special rules (for 
example, reporting and publishing obligations) that  are applicable for the take-over of public 
Rts, i.e. an Rt operates as a public company if par tial or total subscription of its shares is open 
to the public.  
 
According to the Capital Markets Act, before acquis itions related to a public Rt (which has a 
registered seat in the Republic of Hungary or whose  shares are admitted to trading on a 
Hungarian-regulated market) exceeding 33% (or 25% i f there is no shareholder in the public 
Rt other than the bidder holding more than 10% of t he voting rights, whether directly or 
indirectly) can begin, a public take-over bid must be made for all shareholders who have 
voting rights and all shares with voting rights. Th e bid must be approved by the Supervisory 
Authority in advance. A special procedure must also  be conducted under the supervision of 
the State Supervisory Authority. If the bidder has acquired ninety percent or more of the 
voting rights and provided that further conditions of the Capital Markets Act are met, then he 
may exercise his option to purchase the remaining s hares of the public Rt. If the bidder’s 
holding in the public Rt exceeds ninety percent of the voting rights when closing out the take-
over bid, the bidder must purchase the remaining sh ares if so requested in writing by the 
owners of these shares. The Capital Markets Act als o contains an obligation to report and 
publish acquisitions related to public Rts. Since H ungary’s accession to the European Union, 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 14 certain acquisitions must be published in all Membe r States of the European Union where the 
Rt’s shares are officially listed on a regulated ma rket. 
 
The acquisition of listed shares may be rendered co nditional upon additional requirements 
stipulated in the bylaws of the Budapest Stock Exch ange approved by the State Supervisory 
Authority.  
 
In the course of planning the acquisition, details of the relevant legal rules, such as for 
example the Companies Act and the Capital Markets A ct, should also be considered. 
However, the prohibition of a one-member company fr om establishing or acquiring a 
Hungarian one-member company, which was contained i n the previous corporate legislation, 
was removed by the Companies Act. In other words, H ungarian law now allows a chain of 
one-member companies. 
 
3 REGULATIONS FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
3.1 General legislation 
 
The Hungarian Parliament has passed extensive legis lation intended to protect foreign and 
domestic investors from re-nationalization and expr opriation. The most notable legislation is 
Act XXIV of 1988 on Foreign Investment. Hungary has  also concluded bilateral investment 
agreements with several countries which include pro hibitions relating to re-nationalization 
and expropriation. 
 
Hungarian legislation makes no distinction between domestic companies and companies with 
foreign participation. For the establishment, accou nting, employment supervision, and 
insolvency of companies with foreign participation,  the legal provisions applicable to 
domestic companies must also be applied, i.e. they are treated the same as wholly Hungarian-
owned entities. A permit from the foreign exchange authority is not required for the 
foundation of, or participation in, a Hungarian com pany by foreigners. 
 
Companies with foreign participation may be establi shed for any type of economic activity, 
unless precluded by law. Prohibitions and restricti ons are limited to some specific areas, for 
example, water transport, where a shipping license may be subject to majority Hungarian or 
EU ownership. 
 
Permission is not required for foreign investments in financial institutions or insurance 
companies, but solely through the investor’s foreig n domicile, regardless of the size of the 
investment. 
 
European Economic Area nationals and companies, reg istered in the European Economic 
Area, may perform cross-border services under the c onditions and detailed rules laid down in 
specific legislation. 
 
3.2 Acquisition of agricultural land by foreign per sons 
 
Hungary may restrict the acquisition of agricultura l land by foreign persons (natural persons 
and legal entities) and Hungarian legal entities fo r a seven-year transitional period following 
Hungary's accession to the EU. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, nationals of EU Member S tates, European Economic Area 
Member States, and other similar States treated equ ally on the basis of an international treaty, 
who plan to settle in Hungary as private entreprene urial agricultural producers and who have 
been lawfully residing and pursuing agricultural ac tivities in Hungary for a minimum of three 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 15 years, will enjoy the same treatment as Hungarian c itizens with the proviso that they will have 
to provide the necessary documentation as stipulate d in Act LV of 1994 on Arable Land 
(Arable Land Act). 
 
When the above transitional period expires, the sev en-year period may be extended by an 
additional three years based on the difference in l and prices between the European Union and 
Hungary. 
 
3.3 Acquisition of non-agricultural real estate by foreign persons 
 
In general, the acquisition by foreign persons (nat ural persons and legal entities) of non-
agricultural real estate requires the authorization  of the competent authority. This rule does 
not apply to nationals and legal entities of EU Mem ber States, European Economic Area 
Member States, and other similar States treated equ ally on the basis of an international treaty. 
All such nationals and legal entities will be treat ed in the same manner as Hungarian citizens 
and legal entities.  
 
3.4 Acquisition of property by branches 
  
Pursuant to the Branches Act (Act CXXXII of 1997 on  Hungarian Branches and Commercial 
Representative Offices of Foreign-Registered Compan ies), foreign companies registered in 
the EEA or in a state whose citizens may enjoy the same legal treatment on the basis of an 
international treaty as citizens of states that are  party to the EEA Agreement, may acquire the 
ownership of real estate necessary for business act ivities performed through their Hungarian 
branch only if such property is not classified as a gricultural land. Foreign companies 
registered in a state not qualifying as an EEA stat e may acquire the ownership of real estate 
necessary for business activities performed through  their Hungarian branch only if such real 
estate is not classified as agricultural land or a natural preservation area. 
 
No permit is needed for acquiring the ownership tit le of real estate: 
• in the cases defined in international treaties; or 
• if a state of reciprocity in this matter has been e stablished between Hungary and the 
country where the foreign company is registered. 
In the absence of international treaties or a state  of reciprocity, a foreign company may 
acquire the ownership of real estate, if the real e state is required for its business activities 
performed through its Hungarian branch, pursuant to  the applicable legal provisions on the 
acquisition of real estate in Hungary by foreigners . 
 
If the foreign company decides to dissolve its Hung arian branch office, it must sell its branch 
office’s real estate within one year of the dissolu tion of the branch, unless its acquisition of 
title to the same real estate would not be subject to official authorization or unless the county 
public administration office has granted an exempti on from such an obligation. 
 
3.5 Foreign exchange controls 
 
Restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and t ransactions performed in foreign currency 
were mostly removed by a series of laws enacted pri or to Hungary’s accession to the EU. 
Particularly important is Act XCIII of 2001 on Fore ign Exchange Liberalization and the 
Modification of Related Acts (Liberalization Act). 
 
The purpose of the Liberalization Act is to elimina te foreign exchange restrictions and foster 
the free movement of capital. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 16 Pursuant to the Liberalization Act, all entities ca pable of establishment under Hungarian law 
may freely use Hungarian or foreign currency in the ir legal transactions or activities. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, the Liberalization Act s tates that taxes, public dues and other 
payments ordered by public authorities must be paid  in the Hungarian currency (HUF). 
 
3.6 Banking obligations 
 
Companies doing business in Hungary must open a ban k account in a Hungarian bank. 
Nevertheless, there is nothing to prevent a Hungari an company or any Hungarian individual 
from holding a bank account outside of Hungary. 
 
Hungarian legislation allows dividend remittances a nd, if applicable, capital repatriation to 
foreign investors. The Hungarian currency (HUF) is converted at the foreign-exchange rate 
set by the commercial bank engaged in the transacti on. 
 
4 BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS 
 
4.1 Banking system 
 
Hungary has a two-tier banking system, which means that the functions of the central bank 
and other specialized banks (commercial banks and s pecialized institutions) are separate. 
 
The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) is the central b ank and a member of the European 
System of Central Banks (ESCB). The NBH and the mem bers of its decision-making bodies 
perform their duties and carry out their obligation s independently from the government. With 
the exception of the European Central Bank, the NBH  (and the members of its decision-
making bodies) may not ask for or follow instructio ns from the government, the institutions 
and bodies of the European Union, the governments o f other EU Member States or any other 
institution or body. 
 
According to the definition of Act CXII of 1996 on Credit Institutions and Financial 
Enterprises (Financial Enterprises Act), credit ins titutions are financial institutions which 
collect deposits and provide credit lines and loans , and which perform other financial 
services. Depending on the financial activities per formed by a credit institution, it may be 
known as a (commercial) bank, as a specialized cred it institution, or as a co-operative credit 
institution (savings or credit co-operative). 
 
A commercial bank may only operate in Hungary as a company limited by shares (Rt) or as 
the branch office of a foreign bank. A permit from the Hungarian Financial Supervisory 
Authority (PSzÁF – Supervisory Authority) is requir ed before a commercial bank may be 
established and the commencement of operations in H ungary is allowed. In the case of a 
branch office of a foreign bank, a license for bank ing activities issued by its foreign authority 
is also required. The Financial Enterprises Act det ermines the range of financial services that 
commercial banks may provide. 
 
In Hungary, foreigners may only perform financial s ervices in one of two ways: by 
establishing a company limited by shares and regist ered in Hungary, or by founding a 
registered branch office. Banks – including the bra nch offices of foreign credit institutions – 
may be founded with a minimum of HUF 2 billion (EUR  7.1 million) in initial capital. A 
foreign registered credit institution may also esta blish bank representation, but may not 
perform any kind of business activity. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 17 Since Hungary’s accession to the European Union, cr edit institutions registered in another 
Member State of the EU may engage in cross-border s ervices. 
 
4.2 Capital markets 
 
After closing its doors in 1919, the Budapest Commo dity Exchange (BCE) resumed 
operations in November 1989 in order to promote fre e trade in agricultural products. Less 
than a year later, the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE ) opened on 19 June 1990. The BSE and 
BCE were transformed from public corporations into limited companies in 2002 and 2003 
respectively, and then merged in the autumn of 2005 . The last trading day of the BCE was 28 
October 2005, and the first trading day of the Comm odity Section of the BSE was 2 
November 2005. 
 
The aim of the Capital Markets Act (Act CXX of 2001  on Capital Markets) is: 
• to promote development and to improve the competiti ve edge of capital markets on 
the international stage 
• to ensure transparency  
• to improve regulations pertaining to parties involv ed in capital markets  
• to improve the security of investments and to prote ct investors  
• to improve the efficiency of the supervision of cap ital markets 
The Capital Markets Act sets out rules on securitie s issues (including dematerialized 
securities), the conversion of securities, and the marketing of securities (the private and public 
offering of securities and the public offering of g overnment securities). Since July 2005, the 
Capital Markets Act has outlined detailed rules on securities issued on regulated markets, i.e. 
on any exchange market which is included in the lis ts prepared by Member States regarding 
their regulated markets and which is sent to other Member States and the European 
Commission for information purposes. In addition, t he Capital Markets Act also sets out, in 
detail, the rules of the subscription procedure and  the international trading of securities, the 
trading of securities on account, share registers a nd nominees. From December 2007 
regulations governing the service activities of inv estment service providers and commodities 
brokers, formerly contained in the Capital Markets Act, may be found in separate legislation, 
i.e. Act CXXXVIII of 2007 on Investment and Commodi ty Brokers and Their Permitted 
Activities. In order to provide such services, the service provider must submit an application 
to the Supervisory Authority, which will issue the permission if all the conditions set out by 
law are fulfilled. The service provider must report  on its activities to the Supervisory 
Authority annually by providing its annual audited financial statements.  
 
The financial sector – including credit institution s, investment service providers, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the BSE – is under the  auspices of the Supervisory Authority. 
 
Among others, Government Decrees No 250/2000 (XII. 24.) and 348/2004 (XII. 22.) impose 
special accounting rules concerning the stock excha nge, clearing houses and banks. 
 
5 FOREIGN TRADE 
 
5.1 Import and export rules 
 
Products and services may be imported freely into H ungary, subject to certain restrictions. 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 18 Since Hungary’s accession to the European Union (1 May 2004) trade with other Member 
States takes place within the framework of the EU’s  internal market, the main principles of 
which are the free movement of goods, services, cap ital, and persons. 
Trade between the EU and third countries is also re gulated by EU legislation, within the 
framework of the EU’s common commercial policy. Cou ncil Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 of 
22 December 1994 on the common rules for imports (I mport Regulation) applies to products 
imported to the EU originating in third countries, except for textile products which are 
covered by special common rules and products origin ating in certain third countries listed in 
Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994. 
According to the Import Regulation’s general rule, products can be freely imported into the 
EU and, accordingly, are not subject to any quantit ative restrictions, without prejudice to the 
safeguard measures which may be taken under the Imp ort Regulation. Safeguard measures 
may be applied when products are imported into the Community in such greatly increased 
quantities and/or on such terms or conditions as to  cause or threaten to cause, serious injury to 
Community producers. 
In addition, neither the EU rules on the internal m arket, nor the Import Regulation, preclude 
the adoption or application by Member States of mea sures on the grounds of public morality, 
public security, the protection of the health and l ife of humans, animals or plants, the 
protection of national treasures, the protection of  industrial and commercial property, and 
special formalities concerning foreign exchange. 
Under Hungarian law, Government Decree No 110/2004 (IV. 28.) on the Trade of Goods, 
Services and Rights of Material Value Traversing th e State and Customs Frontier (Trade 
Decree) and Government Decree No 16/2004 (II. 6.) –  in line with Council Regulation (EC) 
No 1236/2005 of 27 June 2005 concerning trade in ce rtain goods which could be used for 
capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment  - 
provide for certain exceptions from the EU free tra de rules set out above. According to these 
decrees, export or import transactions of certain p roducts require a license from the 
Hungarian Trade Licensing Office of the Ministry fo r National Development and Economy, 
e.g. transactions with armaments, radioactive mater ials, recyclable or harmful waste, parts or 
derivatives of endangered animal and plant species,  devices used in surveillance, and military 
engineering defense technology. 
As for agricultural legislation, it should be noted  that Hungary now falls under the very 
detailed European agricultural legal system and the  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). 
Other important regulations with respect to drugs ( including psychotropic drugs), chemicals, 
waste, and nuclear products are contained in the de crees of the competent ministers. 
5.2 Anti-dumping regulations 
 
Since Hungary’s EU accession, EU anti-dumping regul ations have been applicable, the main 
source of which is Council Regulation (EC) No 384/9 6 of 22 December 1995 (Anti-Dumping 
Regulation). The intention of the Anti-Dumping Regu lation is to protect the EU against 
imports dumped from third countries, and its applic ation is based on two conditions: (i) the 
existence of dumping; and (ii) the proof of injury to Community industry, be it injury caused 
to an industry established in the Community, the th reat of injury, or substantial retardation of 
the establishment of such an industry. 
 
5.3 Quotas and other non-tariff barriers 
 
Council Regulation (EC) No 520/94 of 7 March 1994 ( Quota Regulation) establishes a 
Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas. The Quota Regulation applies to 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 19 import and export quotas, whether autonomous or con ventional, established by the 
Community. 
The Quota Regulation does not apply to agricultural  products listed in Annex II in the Treaty 
of Rome, to textile products, or to products covere d by special import rules which state 
specific provisions for the administration of quota s. 
The Commission publishes notices in the Official Jo urnal of the European Union which 
announce the opening of quotas, set the allocation method, the conditions to be met by license 
applications, time limits for submitting them, and a list of the competent national authorities 
to which they must be sent. 
Quotas shall be allocated among applicants as soon as possible after they have been opened.  
Quotas may be administered by one of the three meth ods set out in the Quota Regulation, i.e. 
(i) the method based on traditional trade flows; (i i) the method based on the order in which 
applications are submitted; and (iii) the method of  allocating quotas in proportion to the 
quantities requested, by a combination of these met hods, or by any other appropriate method. 
 
6 COMPETITION/ANTITRUST REGULATIONS 
 
6.1 Introduction  
 
The Hungarian competition/antitrust regime consists  of both domestic and EC rules of law 
which regulate market conduct and ensure consumer p rotection. Apart from the general rules, 
some specific products or branches of business are subject to special regulations. 
 
The most important domestic source is Act LVII of 1 996 on the Prohibition of Unfair and 
Restrictive Market Practices (Competition Act). Fur ther rules can be found in sectoral 
legislation, such as the rules concerning telecommu nications, public utility services and 
electricity. Standalone provisions regarding the pr ohibition of the abuse of buyer power of 
certain undertakings were introduced by Act CLXIV o f 2005 on Trade, effective from June 1, 
2006. The Hungarian Criminal Code (1978) contains i mportant anti-trust rules, as certain 
cartels may induce the application of criminal pena lties against both the natural and legal 
person participants. In addition, under the Crimina l Code any person who, either individually 
or as a member of an association of undertakings, a ttempts to unlawfully influence a tender 
procedure may be subject to criminal penalties. 
 
The Competition Act deals mainly with the following  issues: 
• control of concentrations between undertakings 
• prohibition of unfair competition 
• prohibition of unfair manipulation of business deci sions 
• prohibition of agreements restricting competition 
• prohibition of the abuse of a dominant position 
 
6.2 Control of concentrations between undertakings 
 
The Hungarian Competition Authority (HCA) has the p ower to investigate major mergers, 
acquisitions and certain joint ventures, and may pr ohibit them if they would significantly 
impede effective competition in the relevant market , in particular as a result of the creation or 
strengthening of a dominant position. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 20 In the case of company mergers, the Competition Act  requires a compulsory clearance 
application to the HCA if: 
• the combined net sales revenue of all the groups of  companies involved, and the net 
sales revenues of the companies controlled jointly by members of the groups of 
companies involved with other companies in the prev ious financial year exceeded 
HUF 15 billion (EUR 53.6 million); and 
• among the groups of companies involved there are at  least two groups with net sales 
revenues of HUF 500 million (EUR 1.8 million) or mo re in the previous year together 
with the net sales revenues of companies controlled  jointly by members of the same 
group with other companies. 
 
The HUF 500 million (EUR 1.8 million) threshold cov ers those mergers - which took place 
during the two-year period preceding the merger and  which were not subject to authorization 
- between companies that used to be part of the gro up that lost control due to the merger with 
companies from the group that acquired control. 
 
In the case of concentrations between insurance com panies, the value of gross insurance fees 
shall be taken into account instead of the net turn over. In the case of concentrations between 
investment service providers, the income from the i nvestment activity shall be considered and 
in the case of concentrations between funds, the in come from membership fees shall be taken 
into consideration. 
 
In the case of concentrations between credit instit utions and financial enterprises, the 
following income item amounts shall be taken into c onsideration, instead of the net turnover: 
 
a) interest received 
b) income from securities 
i) income from shares and other securities of varia ble returns 
ii) income from holdings 
iii) income from holdings in associated enterprises  
c) commission received 
d) net profit on financial transactions 
e) income from other operating activities 
Concentrations are broadly defined and include merg ers between formerly independent 
undertakings, acquisitions and full-function joint ventures. The determining factor is whether 
the transaction will lead to a lasting change in di rect or indirect control over one or more of 
the undertakings. 
 
If there is a legal requirement to notify a concent ration, then it will be subject to the 
suspending rule contained in the Competition Act, i .e. the merger agreement will be deemed 
unconcluded until it has been authorized by the HCA . 
 
The HCA may not withhold authorization if the trans action would not significantly impede 
effective competition in the relevant market, in pa rticular as a result of the creation or 
strengthening of a dominant position. The HCA will take into account various factors, 
including the evidence of potential new entrants, t he barriers to entry, the availability of 
alternative products, and the impact of the concent ration on the undertakings’ market 
position, among other issues. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 21 The relevant market is defined with regard to the g oods subject to the agreement and to the 
geographical territory. In addition to the goods fo r which the agreement is concluded, goods 
considered reasonable substitutes in terms of use, price, quality and the conditions of 
performance should also be taken into account. 
 
When competition concerns are raised, the HCA has w ide discretion in either applying 
structural remedies (e.g. the divestment of assets or shares, termination of exclusive 
distribution agreements, or severance of vertical l inks with customers, etc.), or requesting 
behavioural undertakings (e.g. licensing certain pr oducts/brands, or granting access on equal 
terms, etc.). 
 
6.3 Prohibition of unfair competition 
 
It is generally prohibited to pursue any unfair bus iness activity that would violate or threaten 
competitors’, business partners’ and/or consumers’ rightful interests, or which conflicts with 
the requirements of business integrity. In addition  to a general clause stating this, the 
Competition Act specifies five types of conduct whi ch are deemed illegal: 
• It is prohibited to violate or jeopardize the good reputation or credit-worthiness of a 
competitor by stating or spreading untrue facts, an d by misrepresenting true facts as 
well as by any other practices. 
• It is prohibited to gain access to or use business secrets in an unfair manner, to 
disclose business secrets to unauthorized parties o r to publish such secrets. 
• It is prohibited to make an unfair appeal to anothe r party, which is aimed at 
dissolving an economic relationship maintained with  a third party, or at preventing 
the establishment of such a relationship. 
• Goods may not be produced, or placed on the market,  or advertised with such a 
typical outside appearance, packaging, or marking b y which a competitor or its goods 
are normally recognized. 
• It is prohibited to interfere with the integrity an d fairness of bidding procedures, 
tenders, auctions, and transactions effected on an exchange in any way. 
A company whose rightful interests have been violat ed or threatened may file an action in the 
civil courts requesting, among other things, the te rmination of the unfair practice, or 
compensation. 
 
6.4 Prohibition of unfair manipulation of business decisions 
 
It is prohibited to deceive business partners in co mpetition. It is especially prohibited to 
deceive business partners with respect to the chara cteristic features of a product or service 
(i.e., the price and essential qualities of the pro duct), to provide misleading information 
regarding the conditions of the sale, or the purcha se of the product or service, or to give a 
false impression of the possibility of a particular ly favourable purchase. It is forbidden to 
limit business partners’ freedom of choice in any w ay. 
 
Unfair practices within this chapter of the Competi tion Act fall within the competence of the 
HCA and investigations are started based on their k nowledge of any unfair practices. 
 
6.5 Prohibition of agreements restricting competiti on 
 
The Competition Act prohibits companies from enteri ng into agreements or concerted 
practices which have as their object or potential o r actual effect, the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition. It is forbidden to enter  into agreements that directly or indirectly fix 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 22 purchase prices, limit distribution, exclude groups  of consumers from purchasing certain 
goods, and hinder market entry, among other things.  
 
Exemptions from the general rule of prohibition are : 
• Agreements of minor importance, i.e. where the join t participation of the contracting 
parties and their subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of the relevant market. This 
exemption does not apply to agreements aimed at pri ce fixing between competitors or 
the division of the market by competitors. 
• Block exemptions. The application of block exemptio ns is subject to the conditions 
set out in the Competition Act and/or the applicabl e Government Decree. 
• The possibility to apply to the HCA for an individu al exemption no longer exists. 
Instead, if the negative consequences of the agreem ent are outweighed by certain 
positive effects (which are enumerated in the Compe tition Act, e.g. contribution to a 
more reasonable organization of production or distr ibution, or the promotion of 
technical or economic development, or a fair part o f the benefits arising from the 
agreement are channelled to the consumer, etc.), th e agreement will be automatically 
exempted from the prohibition. However, the burden of proof that the agreement is 
exempt from the prohibition on this basis rests wit h the party who refers to this 
provision. 
Investigations are started based on the HCA’s knowl edge of any concerted practices or 
restrictive agreements; private enforcement through  the courts is also possible in certain 
matters. 
 
6.6 Prohibition of the abuse of a dominant position  
 
The existence of a dominant position is not prohibi ted in itself. However, the Competition Act 
forbids the abuse of a dominant position and provid es examples of abusive practices, i.e. 
hindering market entry or predatory pricing. 
 
A company is deemed to have a dominant position in the relevant market if it is in a position 
to conduct its economic activities in a manner larg ely independent of others; it does not have 
to consider the market behaviour of its competitors , suppliers, buyers or other business 
partners. 
 
Investigations are started based on the HCA’s knowl edge of any abusive practices; private 
enforcement through the courts is also possible in certain matters. If the abusive conduct is 
manifested in the dominant company’s refusal to ent er into an agreement with another 
undertaking, the undertaking, so refused, may go to  court requesting the conclusion of the 
agreement. 
 
7 CONSUMER PROTECTION 
 
One important aim of Act CLV of 1997 on Consumer Pr otection (Consumer Protection Act) 
is to ensure the safety of goods placed in the mark et, with another being to protect the life, 
health and safety of consumers. Separate legal regu lations or prescriptions by the European 
Union may set forth safety requirements regarding d ifferent products, and if so, these 
products may only be distributed if such requiremen ts are fulfilled.  
 
The Consumer Protection Act also states that consum ers must be properly informed, and that 
products must be suitably packaged. If the legal re gulations on information and packaging are 
violated, the consumer, at his discretion, may enfo rce his rights against the manufacturer, or 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 23 any distributor, regardless of whether or not the m anufacturer was identified. In the latter 
case, the distributor is entitled to enforce a clai m for reimbursement against the manufacturer. 
According to the Consumer Protection Act, a complai nt made by a consumer shall be 
examined and answered within 30 days by the busines s entity. Should the negotiations 
between the consumer and the business entity be uns uccessful, the Consumer Protection Act 
has established a special arbitration board to sett le disputes between a business entity and the 
consumer or, should this fail, to decide on the mat ter expeditiously in order to effectively 
enforce consumers’ rights. Generally, the procedure  of the arbitration board does not prevent 
the business entity or the consumer from enforcing its/his rights in court. 
 
The Hungarian Consumer Protection Authority supervi ses whether the provisions of the 
Consumer Protection Act are properly applied in con sumer relationships. Should the authority 
discover that the business entity did not comply wi th the relevant provisions, it may impose 
legal sanctions, e.g. impose penalties or temporari ly close the business. If certain conditions 
exist, the imposition of a penalty is mandatory on the basis of the Consumer Protection Act. 
The penalty may amount to five per cent of the annu al net sales revenue of a business entity 
whose annual net sales revenue is in excess of HUF 100 million, up to a maximum of HUF 
100 million (EUR 357,000); if the infringement conc erns the lives, health, physical integrity 
of a broad range of consumers, the amount of the pe nalty may be up to HUF 2 billion (EUR 
7.1 million). (Concerning a business entity whose n et sales revenue is under HUF 100 
million, the upper limits of the penalties are: HUF  500,000 (EUR 1,785) and HUF 5 million 
(EUR 17,850) respectively.) 
 
Since 2007 the Consumer Protection Act has also con tained rules regarding the cooperation of 
the consumer protection authorities of Hungary and other countries in the European 
Economic Area, and regarding the enforcement of the  European Union’s most important 
pieces of consumer protection legislation. 
 
Other important legislation also protects the right s of consumers, e.g. Act XLVIII of 2008 on 
Business Advertising Activities and Act XLVII of 20 08 on the Prohibition of Unfair Trade 
Practices Against Consumers. The latter Act establi shes a general prohibition of unfair 
practices via any active or negative conduct which results in the distortion of consumers’ 
conduct. 
 
8 GOVERNMENT-OWNED INDUSTRIES AND PRIVATIZATION 
 
8.1 Government-owned industries 
 
The properties owned by the Hungarian State consist  of: 
• treasury property, which serves the public (e.g. hi storical buildings, forests, state-
owned shares in companies which became state-owned property by using funds 
originating from the central budget and state-owned  funds); and  
• state-owned entrepreneurial assets. 
Treasury property was formerly managed by the Treas ury Property Holding Office and the 
main administrator of state-owned entrepreneurial a ssets was the Hungarian Privatization and 
State Holding Company (ÁPV Zrt). In addition, the n ational land reserves were managed by 
the Land Reserve Management Body. These three bodie s were finally unified into the 
Hungarian National Asset Management Company (MNV Zr t) beginning from January 1, 
2008. 
 
Together with the above changes, Act XXXIX of 1995 on the Sale of State-Owned 
Entrepreneurial Assets (Privatization Act), which a pplied to (i) assets remaining under long-
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 24 term state ownership and (ii) entrepreneurial asset s available for privatization, was repealed 
and replaced by Act CVI of 2007 on National Assets (National Assets Act). 
 
According to the National Assets Act, the Hungarian  State regards the main privatization 
process as having ended. The primary aim of asset m anagement in this case is to preserve 
national assets and to provide for their profitable  operation, which does not preclude the 
possibility of sale. 
 
The annex of the National Assets Act lists those co mpanies in which the Hungarian State will 
keep its stake. These companies are involved in man y industries, from electricity and water 
supply to forestry. 
 
8.2 Privatization 
 
Privatization in Hungary can be divided into four p hases: 
 
I. Up to 1994, the State sold attractive, well-run marketable companies, and at the same time, 
tried to provide assets to the widest possible circ le of small domestic investors. 
 
II. Between 1995 and 1997, large strategic companie s (public utility service providers, banks, 
companies of strategic importance) were privatized at an accelerated pace, mainly to strategic 
investors. 
 
III. Since 1997, capital market transactions (publi c offerings, sales through the stock 
exchange) as well as the privatization of minority stakes have come to the forefront of the 
privatization process. 
 
IV. From 2002, the target has been to finalize priv atization.  
 
By 2007, more than 80% of Hungarian GDP was produce d by the private sector. The 
Government is committed to continuing the privatiza tion process which also generates 
income for the state budget. 
 
Privatization revenues for 2005 and 2006 amounted t o HUF 154 bn and HUF 325.3bn, 
respectively. The key companies which were partiall y or fully sold to private investors 
included Budapest Airport, Malév Hungarian Airlines , FHB Bank and MÁV Cargo (railway 
transportation). 
 
The remaining properties which are expected to be p rivatized in the future primarily represent 
state monopolies. The Government’s privatization po licies, as well as the list of the 
companies which will be sold, are set out in the Na tional Assets Act. In accordance with this 
Act, 25% of the shares minus 1 vote of Magyar Posta  Zrt. (postal services) and MVM Zrt. 
(energy producer and trader), and 100% of ÁAK Zrt. (motorway management) are being 
proposed for sale during 2009 or in subsequent year s. 
 
The privatization of the national gambling monopoly , Szerencsejáték Zrt, is also projected, 
although its minimum rate of state ownership has be en determined at 100% under the 
aforementioned Act, an amendment to which would req uire a Government consensus.  
 
The list of properties for sale is available at MNV  Zrt’s homepage (www.mnvzrt.hu). 
 
The sale of these properties should be performed by  MNV Zrt (i) directly, or (ii) through 
capital market institutions, or (iii) through inves tment funds or investment enterprises. 
 
SZABÓ KELEMEN & PARTNERS ATTORNEYS  
 
 
 25 The assets may be sold through the following proced ures: 
• competition (this may be a public or exclusive tend er or a public auction) 
• public offering

COMPANY FORMS  IN HUNGARY  
The purpose of this brief essay is to give an overview of company forms according to 
Hungarian law, along with some relevant legal standards that define their operation.  
A member of the European Union since 1 May 2004 , Hungary is a country in rapid growth 
and, as such, an attractive destination for prospective investors that wish to set up a local 
enterprise.  
What kind of business associations can be established?  
The previous Act IV of 2006  on Business Associations  which had entered into force on 1 July 
2006 amended several times was overruled by the currently effective Act V of 2013 on the 
Hungarian Civil Code which regulate s the foundation, organization and operation of business 
associations with a registered  seat in Hungary .  
The Hungarian law complies with EU legislation and allows for f oreign nationals  to establish 
business associations in Hungary under the same terms and conditions as Hungarian citizen s. 
1. General Partnership  (Hungarian: “ Közkereseti társaság ”) 
Members of t he partnership shall undertake to jointly engage in business operations with 
unlimited , joint and several liability, and to make available the capital contribution necessary 
for the activities  of the partnership . 
2. Limited Partnership  (Hungarian:  “Betéti társaság ”) 
Members of the partnership shall undertake to jointly engage in business operations, and the 
liability of at least one member ( general partner ) for the obligations of the partnership shall 
be unlimited . If there is more than one general partner,  all general partners shall be  jointly 
and severally liable. A t least one other member ( limited partner ) shall  only be obliged to 
provide the capital contribution undertaken in the Memorandum of Association, and, with the 
exceptions set out in the Hungarian Civil Code , shall not be liable for the obligations of the 
partnership . 
3. Limited Liability Company  (Hungarian: “ Korlátolt felelősségű társaság ”) 
This is a business association founded with an initial capital (so -called subscribed capital) 
consi sting of capital contributions of a pre -determined amount, where the liability of 
members to the company is limited to the provision of the contribution to the initial capital, 
and possibly to other contributions established in the partnership agreement. T his is the most 
common company f orm in Hungary . The minimum subscribed capital required to start a 
company has been recently raised to HUF 3,000,000 (approximately € 10,000 ). 
4. Limited ( Joint -Stock) Company  (Hungarian: “ Részvénytársaság ”) 
Limited companies are business associations founded with a share capital ( subscribed 
capital ) consisting of shares of pre -determined face value, and the obligation of member s 
(shareholder s) to the company is limited to the provision of the face value or issue price of 
shares.  
Private and public limited companies are usually founded for larger investments in terms of 
invested capital. The minimum subscribed capital of a  private limited company  (“Zrt”) is 
HUF 5,000,000 (approximately  € 15,000), while a public limited company  (“Nyrt”) requires a 
capital of at least HUF 20,000,000 (approximately € 60,000). When setting up  a public 
limited company ( “Nyrt” ), at least the 30% of the capital shall be paid in cash and all 
contributions in kind shall  be made available to the company. I f shares of the company are 
subscribed through a n initial public offering , specific provisions have to be followed. 
Privately held companies ( “Zrt”) operate similarly to public limited companies but their 
shares cannot b e listed on the stock exchange  and specific provisions apply to the sale and 
purchase of shares . 
Pursuant to the  law, nonprofit business associations  can also be set up.  
What is the procedure for founding a business association?  
A business association can be founded by both Hungarian and foreign citizens.  
The first step is signing a Memorandum of Association , which is usually drafted and 
countersigned by a legal practitioner or notary. The format of t his document varies depending 
on the kind of business association established.  
Since 16 March 2017, the re is no  administrative fee for founding an association, with the 
exception of privately held companies ( “Zrt”), for which it amounts to HUF 50,000 
(approximately € 150).  
The next ste p is request ing the  inclusion of the company in the Register of Companies , which, 
according to Hungarian law , shall be carried out by a lawyer . 
The following documents shall be submitted with the registration request: Memorandum of 
Association ; acceptance of mandates (executive officers, members of the supervisory board, 
and auditor); statement by the executive officer or certificate from the financial institution 
about the payment of initial contributions; special power of attorney granted to the legal 
representative; certificate of payment of the necessary expenses.  
The registration request shall be submitted to the County Court within thirty (30) days from 
the foundation of the business association.  Foundation of certain types of businesses may 
require prior authorization by relevant authorit ies (e.g. foundation permit in the banking 
sector). In that case, the request of registration shall be issued within fifteen (15) days from 
receipt of the foundat ion permit.  
The Court has eight (8) days to review and approve the request and the attached documents. 
Within the framework of the Hungarian Civil Code and other legal regulations, members 
(shareholders) may freely establish the contents of the articles of  association , according to 
their own personal and economic needs.  
Once the registration is complete d, the association will be  listed in the Register of Companies 
and published in the  Official  Company Gazette (Hungarian: “ Cégközlöny ”).  
What is the corporate tax rate in Hungary ? 
As of  1 January 2017, the Hungarian government cut the corporate tax rate to 9%, and now 
Hungary has the lowest level of corporate taxes in Europe, which gives the country a 
competitive edge to attract  foreign direct investment  to the country .

Company law  
The primary act of law in Hungarian company law is Act 4 of 2006 on Business Associations (Companies Act). 
The main types of business associations under the Companies Act are identical to those regulated in EU 
countries. The procedures on founding, impleme nting changes in data and winding up of Hungarian associations 
are primarily governed by Act V of 2006 on Public Company Information, Company Registration and Winding -up 
Proceedings (Company Procedures Act).  
Under the Companies Act, business associations m ay be founded by non -resident and resident natural persons, 
legal persons and business associations without legal personality. Hungarian laws do not provide an exhaustive 
list of legal persons but, on the basis of the Civil Code, state, municipal, business , social and other organisations 
may have legal personalities. International treaties may contain regulations in derogation from these provisions in 
respect of the participation of non -residents in Hungarian business associations.  
The law may require a spe cial permit from the authority for the foundation of a business association (foundation 
permit), such as, for instance, companies with an interest in financing, insurance or capital market activities, 
which may only be founded with approval from the Hungar ian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF). Where 
authorisation by the authority is prescribed as mandatory by law to engage in a certain economic activity, the 
business association can be founded and registered but it may only begin and pursue the activi ty in question 
when in possession of such authorisation. Activities subject to qualification may only be pursued by business 
associations if there is at least one person among its participating members, employees, or persons working for 
the benefit of the company under a permanent civil law contract concluded with the business association who 
satisfies the qualification requirements set out in the legal regulations.  
FOUNDING OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS  
General partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liabil ity companies, single member companies or private 
limited companies may be founded in a simplified procedure by enclosing with the application for the registration 
of the company the deed of foundation drawn up on the basis of a template in the annex of th e Company 
Procedures Act.  
For a detailed description of the procedure, please refer to the  “Starting up in Hungary”   section of this portal.   
TERMINATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF BUSINES S ASSOCIATIONS  
Business associations may be terminated with or without a legal successor. Cases of termination without a legal 
successor:  
• the period of time specified in the articles of association expires or any other condition of 
termination is realised;  
• the company’s supreme body has adopted a decision for the company’s termination without 
succession (voluntary winding -up or liquidation);  
• the number of members of the business association decreases to one, except for limited liability 
companies and compan ies limited by shares;  
• it is terminated by the court of registration for reasons provided for in the Companies Act;  
•  it is required to do so by law.  
If the business association is terminated by liquidation, the provisions of Act XLIX of 1991 on Bankruptcy and 
Liquidation Proceedings shall apply.  
A business association is terminated with succession in the case of conversion, merger and demerger. ‘Merger’ 
means the operation whereby two or more business associations are wound up without going into liquidation  and 
the companies combine as one legal entity. ‘Demerger’ of a business association is when the business 
association is split into two or more business associations.  
The rules for transformation are contained in the Companies Act and the Accounting Act.   
BRANCH OFFICES AND COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES  
Foreign entrepreneurs may conduct their business in Hungary by opening a branch office in the country. Such a 
branch office is a separate organisation unit of the foreign business association without leg al personality 
registered by the Hungarian court of registration. Through their branch offices, foreign business associations are 
entitled to carry out business activities in Hungary and are represented towards the authorities and third parties 
by their br anch offices. The branch office has full legal capacity, it acquires rights to the benefit of and assumes 
liabilities for the foreign enterprise under its own company name.  
Each branch office shall be registered to the company registry. Branch offices may be represented by natural 
persons employed at or assigned to the branch office or with a permanent contract of employment and a 
domestic place of residence. Representatives of branch offices and their close relatives may only conclude 
transactions within t he activities of the branch office if the deed of foundation of the branch office or the foreign 
business association approves it.  
The laws applicable to companies with domestic registered offices apply to the business activities and the 
domestic business behaviour of branch offices, and its books shall be kept in accordance with the Hungarian 
laws on accounting. Special rules apply to the branch offices of foreign businesses conducting financial activities. 
The employees of the branch office are in employm ent relationship with the foreign business association and 
employer rights are exercised by the foreign business association through its branch office.  
A commercial representative office is an organisational unit of a foreign company without a legal person ality, 
which can operate from the time it is registered in the company register. The scope of activities of commercial 
representation offices are limited to mediating and preparing contracts and carrying out information, advertising 
and propaganda activiti es on behalf of the foreign company.  
In their own names, commercial representative offices may not conduct business activities that yield profits or 
other proceeds; however, they can conclude contracts related to their operation in the name and for the benefit of 
the foreign company. The same  employment rules apply to commercial representative offices as to branch 
offices.  
Investment incentives  
Both refundable and non -refundable incentives are available to investors coming to or expanding in Hungary. The 
main types of incentives related to in vestments are cash subsidies (either from the Hungarian Government or 
from EU Funds), tax incentives, low -interest loans, or land available for free or at reduced prices. The regulations 
on incentive opportunities are in accordance with EU rules.  
REGIONAL AID INTENSITY MAP (2007 -2013)  
The maximum available amounts of regional incentives are based on a regional aid map. All seven regions of 
Hungary are qualified for incentives, and aid intensity varies between 10% and 50% for large corporations, while 
small - and medium -sized companies are able to increase the intensity of the received subsidies by 10 or 20 
percentage points. The maximum aid intensity for the capital city, Budapest, is 10% for large corporations.  The 
maximum available aid intensity decreases i f the investment is a large investment (exceeding EUR 50 million): 
50% of the maximum aid intensity determined in the regional aid map is available for that part of the investment 
between EUR 50 and 100 million, while 34% of the maximum aid intensity for t hat part of the investment beyond 
EUR 100 million. When calculating the maximum available amount of regional incentives, all regional incentives – 
including cash subsidies, development tax incentive, etc. – need to be taken into account.  
Grant decisions mu st be made by December 31, 2013 in order to receive subsidies based on the current regional 
aid intensity map.  
 
CASH SUBSIDIES  
The main types of cash incentives related to investments are focused on implementing the investme nt (e.g. 
purchasing assets, construction work, etc.), creating new jobs and training employees.  
“VIP” INVESTMENT SUBSIDY  
The Hungarian Government provides a negotiation -based “VIP” subsidy opportunity for investments greater than 
EUR 10 million with a cert ain number of newly created jobs, depending on the purpose and location of the 
investment. If the investment is between EUR 10 and 25 million, the Hungarian authorities will investigate the 
possibility of subsidizing the project from available EU Funds.  
The main areas that attract support are investments in manufacturing (greenfield, brownfield or capacity 
extension), shared service centres, research and development, and tourism projects. In order to be eligible for 
the subsidy, 50 -100 new jobs have to be c reated by the investor in the case of manufacturing investments, 
depending on the region where the investment takes place. In the case of large investments of more than EUR 
50 million, 100 -200 new jobs have to be created, depending on the place of the inve stment.  
In the case of establishing or expanding SSCs, at least 100 new jobs have to be created in general, and at least 
200 new jobs in central Hungary.  
In the case of R&D related investments at least 10 new jobs have to be created in connection with the R&D 
activity. Subsidy applications can be submitted to HIPA in either Hungarian or English. The terms and conditions 
of the VIP subsidy are determined in the negotiation procedure between the investor and the Hungarian 
authorities.  
In order to obtain a sub sidy as defined by the current regulation, grant decisions must be made by December 31, 
2013, which is based on the negotiated subsidy agreement.  
"VIP” TRAINING SUBSIDY  

The Hungarian Government also offers what is known as the VIP subsidy opportunity for t raining employees for 
new positions. The subsidy is available to investors creating at least 50 new jobs. The maximum amount of the 
training subsidy for creating 50 to 500 new jobs is EUR 1 and 2 million for creating more than 500 new jobs. It is 
provided for both general and special training. The maximum aid intensity is 60% in the case of general training 
and 25% for targeted training. The aid intensity can be increased further in the case of small - and medium -sized 
enterprises and for training of disable d or disadvantaged workers. The training subsidy is not a regional incentive, 
thus it can be granted on top of the maximum regional aid intensity.  
“VIP” JOB CREATION SUBSIDY  
The Hungarian Government provides a job creation subsidy for those investments ent itled to VIP investment 
subsidies and that create at least 250 new jobs in disadvantaged or least -developed micro -regions. The 
maximum available subsidy is EUR 3 million, depending on the location and the number of new employees.  
VOCATIONAL TRAINING FACILI TY SUBSIDY GRANTED BY INDIVIDUAL DECISION  
A subsidy opportunity is available for establishing vocational training facilities and the development of the 
equipment for practical training. In order to be eligible for the subsidy, the number of vocational scho ol students 
with training agreements has to be increased by at least 50 compared to the average number of trainees in the 
two school years prior to the submission of the subsidy request.  
The maximum subsidy amount is EUR 8,000 per student, and the total su bsidy received cannot exceed EUR 2 
million per beneficiary.  
CASH SUBSIDIES FROM THE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION FUND  
Subsidy opportunities are available from the Hungarian national budget, primarily aimed at R&D activities 
involving a broad cooperation of companies, universities and research institutions. The subsidies are available 
through a tendering process.  
NON -REFUN DABLE CASH SUBSIDIES FROM EU FUNDS  
A wide range of tender opportunities are available from EU Funds, for which investments of less than EUR 10 
million can also qualify. The conditions for the EU tender application, the timing, and the total amount of the 
subsidy available vary from tender to tender. The tenders reflect the importance given to supporting R&D 
activities, the creation of new workplaces, environmental investments, and technological investments (with 
preference given to small and medium sized en terprises).  
Cash subsidies from EU Funds for 2011 -2013 are available through the New Széchenyi Plan (Új Széchenyi Terv 
in Hungarian, also known by its initials ÚSzT), which was announced in January 2011. The plan focuses on the 
following areas:  
• Health indu stry 
• Green economy  
• Enterprise development  
• Science – innovation  
• Employment  
• Transportation  
For a more detailed overview of the available cash subsidies in Hungary please visit the web site of  Hungarian 
Investment Promotio n Agency (HIPA)  
TAX INCENTIVES  
Tax incentives are available for companies’ future transactions. Applications have to be submitted to the 
competent authority in Hungary or to the competent EU institution before projects start.  
DEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVE  
Each development tax incentive may be claimed for a 10 -year period (beginning after completion of the 
development) in Corporate Income Tax (“CIT”) returns within a maximum period of 14 years from the original 
application for the incentive.  
In any given tax year, the tax incentive is availab le for up to 80% of the tax payable, but in total up to the state aid 
intensity ceiling. Applications for tax incentives have to be submitted to the Ministry for National Economy, and 
the Hungarian Government has the right to grant permission if the aggreg ate eligible costs of the investment 
exceed EUR 100 million. If the investment is below this threshold, taxpayers only need to notify the Ministry for 
National Economy before starting the investment.  
OTHER TAX INCENTIVES  
Various Corporate Income Tax and Lo cal Business Tax bases incentives and allowances apply to special 
business areas and activities such as R&D performed by the taxpayer themselves, job creation by shared service 
centres (SCCs), or companies supporting film production, performing arts and sp ectator sports.  
For a more detailed overview of the available tax incentives in Hungary please visit the web site of  Hungarian 
Investment Promotion Agency . 
  
Labour law  
The rules of labour law are regulated in Act I of 2012 (Labour Code). The regulation is very similar to the labour 
laws of other European countries in that it has only minimum requirements as to the content of employment 
contracts. Employment contracts, mo dification and termination of employment must be incorporated in writing. 
Employment contracts are usually concluded for an indefinite period of time.  
At the beginning of the employment relationship, the parties may specify a probationary period for a maxi mum of 
three months, or in case of a collective bargaining agreement for a maximum of six months. Employment 
contracts may also be signed for definite terms but the extension thereof requires the existence of the legitimate 
economic interest of the employe r, and the period thereof may not exceed 5 years together with the extension of 
the contract.  
Termination of employment is usually based on mutual agreement of the parties or a unilateral notice given by 
one of the parties. Note that the employer is requir ed to provide a reason for its termination of the employee’s 
contract and that the reason must be realistic and rational. Employees may terminate their employment by notice 
without the obligation to provide a reason. In case of termination with immediate e ffect, both the employer and 
the employee are required to provide a substantial and verified reason. Employees have a 30 -day forfeit period 
for legal remedies if the reason provided for the termination with notice or with immediate effect is contrary to th e 
law. 
Even though the law has provisions for part -time employment and distance working (“home office”), these 
methods are not yet widely used. Regular working hours are 40 hours per week, Monday to Friday. Working time 
conditions (e.g. the ceiling) and ex tra payment for overtime are strictly regulated by the law.  
The annual paid holiday is 20 workdays, which increases with the age of the employee in categories with the 
maximum being 30 days. Pregnant women are entitled to 24 weeks of maternity leave. By th e main rule (i.e. in 
the case of one healthy child), childcare benefit is available until the child reaches the age of 3. The labour law 
protects women on maternity leave and those receiving childcare benefit against regular termination of their 
employment . The age limit for the full old -age pension varies between 62 and 65 years depending on the date of 
birth.  
Citizens of EU member states and their family members may be employed in Hungary without a work permit 
since 1 January 2009. For statistical purpose s the employer is required to report the employment data of EU 
citizens to the employment centre.  
No residence permit is necessary for EU citizens who plan to spend more than 3 months in the country for 
employment purposes. Nevertheless, they are required to report the details of their extended stay to the Office of 
Immigration and Nationality and to apply for a residence card.  
With a few exceptions, non -EU citizens need work permits to work in Hungary. Individual work permits are 
usually valid for a maximu m of 2 years with the option of extension for another 2 years. Officially, the employee 
applies for the work permit, but first the employer must document that they had already tried to fill the position 
with a Hungarian citizen with the help of the employm ent centre. Non -EU citizens may only begin their 
employment in Hungary after they have obtained all permits and documents necessary for their employment.

Avoidance of Double Taxation  
 
PERSONAL INCOME TAX  
1. TAXPAYERS  
In Hungary, the income of private individuals resident in Hungary is comprehensively taxable, they pay taxes on 
the basis of their domestic and foreign income. The tax liability of private individuals having tax residence abroad 
only encompasses income gen erated from Hungary or income taxable in Hungary based on international 
agreements or reciprocity.  
2. TAXABLE INCOME  
Any type of income of private individuals is taxable in respect of personal income tax except for those which are 
exempted from tax by law.  Act CXVII of 1995 on Personal Income Tax (henceforward: PIT tax) identifies the 
following income categories for private individuals:   
• Incomes from activities other than self -employment, self -employment activities and other 
consolidated incomes belong to t he category of incomes to be consolidated.  
• Separately taxed incomes are capital gains, incomes from private entrepreneurship, and 
incomes generated from the sale of real estate or movable property.   
As of 2016 the rate of personal income tax is 15%.  
2.1. T AX EXEMPT INCOME  
Tax exempt incomes are mostly discussed by Section 7 and Schedule 1 of the PIT Act.  
The following types of incomes belong to this category:  
• certain forms of state allowances paid for raising children;  
• scholarships paid by non -resident entities to students studying abroad or researchers working 
abroad;   
• certain services provided by insurers;  
• pensions including state pension benefits and pension s paid by private pension funds, and 
incomes defined as pension on the basis of the provisions of agreements for the avoidance of 
double taxation.  
2.2. INCOME FROM ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SELF -EMPLOYMENT  
The PIT Act identifies incomes from activities other t han self -employment which comprise, among others, 
activities pursued in an employment relationship, the activities of executive officers of business associations, and 
the personal participation of private individual members of a business partnership.  
Incom e from activities other than self -employment comprises wages paid to a private individual in compensation 
of their activities, bonuses, and income paid on the basis of personal participation, as well as managerial and 
elected officer activities. Generally costs may not be subtracted from the income.  
2.3. INCOME FROM SELF -EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES  
All activities, as a result of which a private individual receives income and which are not included in the sphere of 
activities other than self -employment are conside red self -employment activities. This includes, in particular, the 
activities of small -scale agricultural producers, private entrepreneurs, lessors, appointed auditors, and people 
pursuing activities in employment under commission agency.  
As a general rule the income generated from self -employment activities – apart from those pursued in private 
entrepreneurship – is regarded as the amount of all income with all expenses subtracted.   
The taxpayer may choose from two methods of expense accounting:  
• itemized ex pense accounting (on the basis of certified actually arising expenses) or   
• 10 per cent of the revenues can be accounted without certification.  
Only one method of expense accounting may be applied throughout one tax year.  
Income generated from royalties at the original beneficiary is taxed in accordance with the rules pertaining to 
income from self -employment activities.  
Special rules are applicable for private entrepreneurs.   
Instead of the itemized expense accounting or the 10 percent expense ratio, small -scale agricultural producers 
may elect flat rate taxation.  
2.4. BENEFITS WHICH CAN BE GRANTED UNDER THE TAXES PAYABLE BY PAYERS  
These include benefits and services provided under the title of entertainment and promotional gifts, products and 
services provi ded to each employee (or a certain group of employees according to the internal regulations of the 
employer) either free of charge or at a discount price, eating and other services arising in respect of business 
trips. The base of tax is the value of the b enefits multiplied by 1.19. The rate of tax is 15 percent. Besides the 
personal income tax, the payer, employer also has to pay the 27 percent healthcare contribution.  
2.4.1. Non -wage benefits   
Such benefits are, for instance – up to various threshold values separately defined for particular benefits – are 
the following items provided free of charge or at a discount price:  
• travel passes for local public transportation;  
• board services   
• Erzsébet Vo ucher for the purchase of meals ready for consumption or hot meals in restaurants   
• holiday services provided in resort facilities owned by the provider   
• benefits transferred by the employee to a private individual’s account in voluntary pension funds, 
aid and healthcare funds.  
The base of tax is the value of the benefits multiplied by 1.19, and the tax is payable by the payer or the 
employee. The rate of tax is 15 percent. Besides the personal income tax, the payer, employer also has to pay 
the 14 percent h ealthcare contribution in accordance with the rules in effect on 2016.  
2.4.2. Low interest loans  
In case of no interest or low interest loans, the payer, employer pays the tax on the amount of income arising 
from the unpaid interest. The tax base is the in terest discount multiplied by 1.18 and the rate of tax is 15 percent 
and the 27 percent of healthcare contribution also has to be paid. When the income arising from the no interest or 
low interest loan is established the base rate of the Prime Bank of Hung ary shall be taken into account with an 
additional 5 percentage points also added – and that is compared to the actually charged interest.  
In cases defined in law, the income generated from discount interests is free of taxes.  
2.4.3. Shares and option  
If a corporation provides share to its employees in the framework of a share distribution system for employees, 
no taxable income is derived when shares are distributed if the aggregate amount of the regular market price of 
the thus acquired securities does no t exceed 1 million HUF.  
3. PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURIAL REVENUES  
Private entrepreneurs under the effect of the PIT Act are obliged to pay private entrepreneurial tax and dividend 
tax. If the conditions defined in law are met, the private entrepreneur may opt fo r flat rate taxation or may register 
under the Simplified Entrepreneurial Tax (EVA) and Fixed -Rate Tax of Low Bracket Enterprises (KATA).  
The entrepreneurial withdrawal (the actual wage of a private entrepreneur) generated from economic activities 
and also  accounted for as an expense shall be indicated among the incomes to be consolidated.   
The tax base of the entrepreneurial income is taxed as the difference between the total aggregate income and 
expense. There is a minimum personal income tax and contribu tions base for private entrepreneurs for which 
public dues are to be paid.   
The system of writing off depreciation allowances is similar to the system applied with employees of companies.   
The private entrepreneur has the option to account for their losses  that were deferred in due observation of the 
principle of proper execution of the law within its meaning and intent  against their revenues derived from the 
private entrepreneurship in the ensuing five tax years (but in the year of cancelling of their bus iness activities at 
the latest) in accordance with rules defined in the PIT Act at the latest.   
The rate of tax imposed on entrepreneurs is 10 percent until a tax base of 5000 million HUF and 19 percent 
above that.   
Entrepreneurs opting for flat rate taxat ion pay tax on the basis of their total revenues with a fixed amount of 
expense ratio subtracted, the expense ratio varies between 40 percent and 93 percent according to the sphere of 
activity. The income defined as a flat rate amount is a part of the cons olidated tax base.  
4. INCOME FROM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS   
The payer automatically subtracts tax from the dividend income. The agreement on the avoidance of double 
taxation regulates tax liabilities regarding the dividend income of the private individuals of f oreign tax residence, 
and if no such agreement exists, the rate of tax is 15 percent.   
In the case of foreign dividend income of private individuals of Hungarian tax residence, the amount of dividend 
tax certifiably paid abroad can be subtracted from the 1 5 percent of taxes. If Hungary has no agreement on the 
avoidance of double taxation with the particular country, then the tax rate in Hungary is 5 percent at least.  
A 15 percent rate of personal income tax is also imposed on the income generated from inter ests. Among others, 
the interest paid on deposits made on savings accounts, the interest and other income derived from publicly 
offered and traded securities and investment certificates qualify as interest.  
A personal income tax of 15 percent is payable on  the income realized upon the sale of securities (capital gains). 
The tax base is the selling price with the documented expenses, such as the entry price and the transactional 
costs subtracted.   
A 15 percent tax is imposed on the income withdrawn from busi ness accounts.  
Dividends, interests or capital gains paid by legal persons or other organizations seated in offshore countries 
qualify as taxable income to be consolidated.   
It is worthwhile to take care of the fact that – on the basis of Act LXXX of 1997 on on the Eligi bility for Social 
Security Benefits and Private Pensions and the Funding for These Services (henceforward: Tbj) – a 14 percent 
healthcare contribution is also payable on the income generated from dividends, capital gains and incomes 
withdrawn from business  accounts with the 15 percent tax rate.  
With the exceptions determined in law a 6 percent healthcare contribution is imposed on the income generated 
from interests. A foreign private individual – defined as such by the Tbj – has the option to reclaim the 6  percent 
healthcare contribution subtracted by the payer.  
5. THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION   
The avoidance of double taxation is performed on the basis of the provisions of agreements on the avoidance of 
double taxation, and on the basis of Hungarian leg al regulations if no such agreement exists.  
In case an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation exists, its relevant provisions are to be applied in 
respect of foreign income.  
The income of a private individual of foreign tax residence – taxable in Hu ngary on the basis of an agreement on 
the avoidance of double taxation – is taxed in accordance with the rules pertaining to individuals with a Hungarian 
tax residence. The income of a Hungarian private individual which is taxable abroad on the basis of th e 
agreement is exempted from taxation by Hungary (with dividends being typical exceptions).  
If nothing else follows from international contracts or the principle of reciprocity, the calculated tax is reduced by 
90 percent of the tax paid abroad, but – at most – by the tax established with the tax rate applicable to the tax 
base of that income.  
6. ADMINISTRATION (TAX RETURNS, TAX PAYMENT)   
The declaration of personal income tax takes place on the basis of self -assessment. Non -entrepreneurial private 
individu als may request the assistance of the tax authority for preparing their tax returns. Employers and payers 
are obliged to subtract taxes and advance tax payments from the wages and other payments they pay. The 
private individuals themselves are obliged to p ay the taxes or advance tax payments on the income they earned 
if the income has not been paid by a payer or employer.   
The annual tax returns of private individuals are to be filed until 20th May of the year following the tax year, and 
until 25 February f or private individuals obliged to pay VAT and private entrepreneurs. This is the deadline of 
paying taxes potentially still outstanding with the subtracted or paid tax advance payments taken into 
consideration.  
Tax return obligations are to be complied wit h on forms distributed by the tax authority.   
CORPORATE INCOME TAX  
Subject of corporate income taxes:  
• domestically resident economic companies and other organizations defined in the Act on 
Corporate Income Tax,  
• enterprises resident in foreign countries.  
Taxable persons resident in Hungary are obliged to pay taxes on their ‟revenues from the world” (that is, both 
their revenues from Hungary and abroad). Those foreign enterprises that pursue entrepreneurial operations in a 
domestic permanent establishment (ar e known in Hungary as ‟foreign enterprises”) pay taxes in Hungary on their 
income earned from their entrepreneurial operations performed at their domestic permanent establishment.  
For the definition of permanent establishment, the terms of the relevant agr eement on the avoidance of double 
taxation (and in the lack of such an agreement, the provisions of the Act on Corporate Income Tax) are to be 
taken into account.  
If a foreign entrepreneur decides to place the premises of their management in Hungary, they become a 
domestically resident taxpayer on the basis of their Hungarian premises of management. The transfer of 
business management must be reported to the tax authority by using the form no. 'T201 (can be downloaded 
from here:  http://nav.gov.hu/nav/letoltesek/nyomtatvanykitolto_programok/nyomtatvan... ). 
The base of tax  is the result before taxation modified by the correctional items defined in the corporate tax act. 
The following are the most important out of those:  
• deferred los ses 
• correctional items related to deprecation  
• correctional items related to received royalty  
• received dividends  
• profits made by an off -shore company   
• reliefs awarded for research and technology  
• costs arising for purposes other than the company  
• investment tax base reliefs  
• transfer pricing rules.  
The rate of corporate tax  is 10 percent up to the amount not exceeding 500 million HUF of the positive tax base 
and 19 percent on the part that does excee d 500 million HUF.   
TAX RELIEFS  
Up to a determined percentage of the calculated corporation tax certain tax reliefs are available out of which the 
following are the most important:  
• investment tax relief of small and medium enterprises  
• development tax relie f 
• tax relief for the support of spectacular team sports.  
  
The company income tax is assessed and declared through self -assessment. The tax year is generally the 
calendar year, but there is an option to choose a business year different from the calendar ye ar (for instance due 
to the nature of the business and the information needs of the parent company).  
Tax returns  are to be submitted by May 31st of the year following the tax year for taxpayers operating in 
accordance with the calendar year and by the last  day of the fifth month following the tax year for those taxpayers 
who use a business year different from the calendar year.  
The tax return can be downloaded from the website of the National Tax and Customs Administration.  
RULES REGARDING COMPANIES HAVING REAL ESTATE  
Those foreign persons who had acquired income as a result of selling or withdrawing their share in a company 
having real estate (referred to in Hungary as “members of companies having real estate) are obliged to pay a tax 
to the Hungarian tax authority wit h the rate of the company income tax. The base of tax is the positive amount of 
price at the time of selling the share or at the time of the reduction of the registered capital of the company with 
the price of the acquisition and the certified expenses rel ated to the acquisition or holding of the share subtracted.  
  
The Hungarian transfer price regulations  have been prepared in harmony with OECD regulations.  
Related parties are required to set prices in their contracts that are used in contracts signed with  independent 
parties under the same conditions. If the related parties in their contracts or agreements signed with one another 
apply a higher or lower counter value than the one that would be used in contracts signed with independent 
parties under the sam e condition, the tax base must or may be modified with the difference between the 
customary market price and the applied counter value. The taxpayer must increase the pre -tax earnings with the 
difference if due to the difference it has achieved lower pre -tax earnings than what it would have achieved with 
the application of the customary market price.  
The taxpayer is generally obliged to prepare a transfer pricing documentation on the basis of its contracts and 
agreements in force with related parties if per formance took place under these contracts and agreements in the 
tax year. No transfer pricing documentation is required from taxpayers who qualify as micro and small 
businesses.

labour market objectives.   
Among others ensured are:  
• those in an employment relationship,  
• the private entrepreneurs and members of business partnerships if not retired,  
• persons in a speci al legal relationship of working personally in exchange for compensation (for 
instance on the basis of a commission contract) if their compensation reaches a certain amount 
of money.  
The ensured  
• pays an 8.5 percent healthcare and labour market contribution  and  
• a 10 percent pension contribution.

Contributions paid by private entrepreneurs  
The ensured private entrepreneur pays a 10 percent pension contribution and 8.5 percent labour market 
contribution. In case of tax payment according to the entrepreneurial revenues, the tax base is the 
entrepreneurial withdrawal, in case of flat rate taxatio n, the base of contribution is the income established in the 
lump sum with the condition that the base of the pension contribution is at least the monthly minimum wage 
(111,000 HUF in 2016), and the base of the health insurance and labour market contributi on is at least the 
amount one and a half times that of the minimum wage.   
The rules of the contribution payment obligations of the private entrepreneur are different from the above if they 
are full -time students in a secondary school or higher education es tablishment, or they are in an employment 
relationship besides their entrepreneurial activities or if they are retired etc.   
Administration:  The ensured private entrepreneur is obliged to declare and pay their contributions until the 12th 
day of the month following the month in question.  
Contributions paid by members of business partnerships

and business partner. Its rate is 27 percent. The payable tax can be reduced by reliefs defined in law.  
THE BASE OF TAX

payment is calculated from the income taxable in accordance with the PIT Act, derived from self -employment and 
non-self-employment and paid by the pa yer to a natural person that is in a legal relationship with them resulting in 
tax payment obligations. In the lack of an income defined above, the base salary fixed in the working contract or 
the salary defined in the commission contract is the tax base.

and payment is the 12th day of the month following the month in question.  
Legal background:  
•    Chapter IX of Act CLVI of 2011 on the amendment of certain tax laws and acts related to them (Szocho Act)  
3. HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTION  
Healthcare contribution is payable for certain defined incomes in order to supplement resources to fund 
healthcare services. Such obligation however does not arise in respect of foreign persons with the exception of 
performing artists.  
In accordance with t he PIT Act a performer with a foreign residence can decide to comply with their tax payment 
obligations arising on the basis of their domestically taxable income paid by a person not qualifying as a payer to 
compensate for their activities done in Hungary as a performer in accordance with special rules.   
In this case the performer with a foreign residence is obliged to pay a 14 percent healthcare contribution for their 
income that consists the base of personal income tax the upper limit of which is 450,000 HUF in the tax year.  
Administration : A natural person establishes, declares and pays their healthcare contributions described above 
simultaneously with the personal income tax.

Legal background:  
• Act LXVI of 1998 on healthcare contributions (Eho Act)  
4. VOCATIONAL CONTRIBUTION  
Economic companies and private entrepreneurs pay a vocational con tribution of 1.5 percent.  As a main rule, the 
base of the contribution is identical of the tax base of the social contribution tax. In certain cases the base of 
vocational contribution can be reduced by the gross amount of wage of the person employed, but by 100,000 
HUF per month at most (e.g. if the employee is a career starter).  
Legal background:  
• Act CLV of 2011 on Vocational Contribution and the support of training  
VALUE ADDED TAX  
Act CXXVII of 2007 on value added tax (VAT Act) is in line with the VAT di rective of the EU. Taxpayers with no 
residence in Hungary but liable to pay taxes in Hungary have to register under the VAT taxation scheme.  
The scope of the VAT Act covers the following: the supply of goods, the intra -Community acquisition of goods, 
the s upply of services and the importation of goods.  
• The place of the supply of goods and the supply of services determines whether or not the 
Hungarian VAT Act applies to the transaction: according to general rules, if the goods are not 
dispatched as a consign ment or not transported, the place of supply of the goods is the place 
where the goods are actually located at the time when the supply takes place; when the goods 
are transported, the place of supply where the goods are located at the time when the dispat ch 
or transport of the consignment is started.  According to general rules, the place of supply of 
services performed for a taxable person shall be the place where the customer has established 
his business or, in the absence of such a place of business, th e place where he has his 
permanent address or usually resides.  
• The place of supply of services performed for a non -taxable person is the place where the 
supplier has established his business, or, in the absence of such a place of business, the place 
where he has his permanent address or usually resides.  
Currently in H ungary there are three tax rates in force: the standard rate of 27 percent, reduced rates of taxation 
of 18 percent or 5 percent. Beyond these, the Hungarian VAT system also contains tax exempted areas.  
The vast majority of products sales in markets, fairs  and/or exhibition events are categorized within the tax rate of 
27 percent. Within the reduced rate of taxation of 18 percent certain milk and bakery products are classified, as 
well as commercial accommodation services, under the 5 percent rate certain m edicine, healthcare equipment, 
books, e -books, periodicals and district heating are classified.   
As a general rule, taxpayers are required to file a tax return in every year quarter.  
The frequency of submitting value added tax returns may be monthly, year  quarterly or annual depending on the 
tax output – or in certain cases, the income. Certain taxpayers – such as tax subjects starting their taxable 
activities in Hungary in the year of their registration and in the following year – are obliged to file mont hly tax 
returns.  
Regarding the provisions of the Act on VAT, the rule in effect as of 1 January 2016 must be highlighted which 
renders new apartments constructed or to be constructed in multi -apartment complexes and not exceeding 150 
square meters in area,  as well as new real estate properties with single apartments not exceeding 300 square 
meters in area under the 5% tax rate.

LOCAL TAXES  
Under the empowerment of the Act Nr. 100 of 1990 on Local Taxes and according to its provisions the 
representative body of the local government may introduce local and community taxes with its decrees.  
COMMUNITY TAXES  
The act on local taxes only curbs the circle of possible tax subjects but besides it does not constitute frames – 
possible tax objects, bearings of the tax case, the burdens of determining tax relating local taxes –, within which 
the local government is al lowed to introduce community tax.  
Administration:  depending on the local decree either the local government imposes the tax based on the tax 
declaration of the taxpayer or the taxpayer sets the tax himself.  
BUILDING TAX  
Building tax liability is linked to buildings and building sections either used for housing purposes or not 
(hereinafter referred to as “buildings”). The tax base of building tax may be the net floor space expressed in 
square meters, or the adjusted market value of the building as the local government may decide.  
Subject to the tax are private individuals, legal persons and other organizations who is the owner of the building 
(or holder of a right regarding to the building) as of the first day of the calendar year.  
The act on local taxes impl ies several exemptions (eg. temporary housing units) but the local government has the 
empowerment to extend the exemption rules.  
The maximum rate of building tax per annum is 1100 HUF/sqm for tax based on net floor space or 3,6% of the 
adjusted market valu e. 
Administration:  the local government imposes the tax based on the tax declaration of the taxpayer or the 
taxpayer sets the tax himself.  
PROPERTY TAX  
Property tax liability covers properties lying in the area of jurisdiction of the municipal government. The tax base 
is – depending on the decision of the municipal government – the actual area of the land parcel expressed in 
square meters, or the adjusted market value of the parcel.  
Subject to the tax are private individuals, legal persons and other organizations who are the owner of the building 
(or holder of a right regarding to the building) as of the first day of the calendar year.  
The act on local taxes implies several exemptions  (eg. parcel under building prohibition) but the local government 
has the empowerment to extend the exemption rules.  
The maximum rate of building tax per annum is 200 HUF/sqm for tax based on the area of the parcel or 3% of the 
adjusted market value.   
Admi nistration:  the local government imposes the tax based on the tax declaration of the taxpayer or the 
taxpayer sets it himself.  
PERSONAL COMMUNITY TAX  
Personal community tax is actually a simplified form of building and property taxes, it is a so called fla t tax and its 
subject may only be private individuals. The tax object may be the building or property in the ownership of the 
taxpayer or under some right of the taxpayer or the right to lease of a building in the ownership of a non -
individual. For the sta rting of tax liability for properties in the ownership or under the right of private individuals the

The maximum rate of personal community tax per annum is 17 000 HUF per tax object.

TOURISM TAX

government, spending at least one guest -night there.  
Depending on the decision of the local government the tax base may be either the number of guest -nights spe nt 
or the price of the accommodation.   
The tax measure is adjusted to the tax base. The maximum tax rate is 300 HUF/person/night, or 4% of the price 
or offset of accommodation.

LOCAL BUSINESS TAX  
All business activities pursued (for income or profit) permanently or temporarily in the area of jurisdiction of a 
local government (hereinafter referred to as 'commercial activity') shall be s ubject to taxation.  
The taxable person shall be the entrepreneur according to the act on local taxes, furthermore, the assets 
managed in a trust fund under a fiduciary asset management contract as provided for in the Civil Code shall be 
subject to taxation . 
The character of the activity may be permanent or temporary.  
An entrepreneur whose commercial domicile or place of business is located in the area of jurisdiction of a local 
government shall be regarded as conducting permanent commercial activities, rega rdless of whether any or all of 
his operations are conducted outside his commercial domicile (place of business).  
Commercial activities shall be regarded temporary if, in the area of jurisdiction of a municipal government, an 
entrepreneur without a commerc ial domicile or place of business registered in such area is engaged in: 
construction, or any activity, that directly results in income, provided that the entrepreneur does not have a 
commercial domicile or place of business registered in the area of juris diction in Hungary.  
The tax base of local business tax – similarly to the tax liability – depends on whether the activity is permanent or 
temporary. Moreover in case of permanent activity of some certain taxpayers the act on local taxes provides a 
simplifi ed setting of the tax base.  
For permanent business activity the tax base of local business tax is the net sales revenue according to the local 
business act curtailed by the sum total of the original costs of goods sold and the value of mediated services, 
sums paid to subcontractors, material costs, and the direct costs of basic research, applied research and 
experimental development claimed for the tax year.  
For any entrepreneur who is engaged in the pursuit of commercial activities on a permanent basis in the areas of 
jurisdiction of more than one municipal governments or abroad, the tax base shall be divided, with regard to the 
most characteristic nature of the activities performed, by the entrepreneur as prescribed in Schedule No. 3 of the 
act on local ta xes. 
For permanent commercial activities the maximum rate of tax per annum is 2% of the tax base.  
For temporary commercial activities the tax rate shall be maximum 5,000 forints per calendar day.  
The amount of the tax to be payed to the local government ac cording to the domicile or place of business may be 
lessened with the items described in the act on local taxes (up to that amount).  
The local government is permitted to set tax exemption or tax reduction – beyond the exemptions in the tact on 
local taxes according to the conditions defined there.  
Administration:  the taxpayer sets, declares and pays the tax to the local tax authority.

Accoun ting and bookkeeping in Hungary are regulated by the Accounting Act and the statutes issued by the 
Ministry for National Economy. In addition to the Accounting Act, some special rules apply to financial institutions, 
insurance companies, state budget organ isation and municipalities. Hungarian accounting regulations are

legal personality, building communities or Hungarian commercial representations of businesses registered 
abroad.  
Accounting records and the financial report have to be prepared in Hungarian and in accordance with accounting 
princ iples.

Cross -border Provision of Services in Hungary  
Under Hungarian laws, cross -border provision of a service means a service activity in the territory of Hungary 
without establishing premises, on a temporary or occasional basis, thus the service provider does n ot establish a 
permanent economic presence.   
Whether an activity is pursued by a given service provider by establishing premises or as a cross -border 
provision of service shall always be determined for each single case, first of all by taking into consider ation the 
duration, frequency, regularity and continuity of the given service activity.  
Legislation often uses the term ‘service provider entitled to freedom in service provision’ as synonym for the term 
‘service provider entitled to cross -border service p rovision’.  
The principal rule is the freedom to provide cross -border services, which means that a service provider having 
premises in another Member State of the European Economic Area and legally pursuing the service activity 
there, does not need to obtai n a licence, to register the commencement of the service activity or to have any 
certificate, official certificate or card to provide cross -border services in Hungary.  
A service provider who is entitled to the freedom of service provision may not be limite d in cross -border provision 
of services in the territory of Hungary as a principal rule, and the obligatory requirements relating to the 
commencement and pursuance of service activities set out in the relevant laws shall not apply to these service 
provider s. 
However, there are some rules which shall apply to the service provider in case of cross -border 
provision of services in the territory of Hungary. These rules are the following:  
1. requirements for the protection of public order and public safety, and requ irements in the interest 
of national security and national defence, and further requirements for public health or 
environmental reasons set out in special laws or government decrees,   
2. requirements set out in the provisions of Act on the Recognition of Fore ign Certificates and 
Degrees in respect of the freedom to provide cross -border services, and other requirements of 
laws, according to which a given activity may only be pursued by persons qualified to pursue 
certain regulated professional activities,  
3. the s tatutory provisions on the protection of personal data and the disclosure of data of public 
interest,  
4. in civil, family and labour legal relationships the provisions relating to the conclusion, validity and 
legal force of contracts, and provisions relating to responsibilities for contract and tort damages, 
and further provisions relating to jurisdiction and the applicable law,  
5. provisions of law relating to the parties’ entitlement to legal counsel, and relating to compulsory 
legal counsel in proceedings at c ourt or compulsory appointment of a notary public,  
6. establishment, existence or enforcement of intellectual property rights,  
7. requirements relating to the entrance of foreign citizens and to their staying in Hungary  
8. requirements set out in EU legislation on the coordination and implementation of social security 
systems  
9. the relevant rules applicable pursuant to the Act of the Labour Code, if an employee is employed 
by a foreign employer on the territory of Hungary on the basis of delegation, assignment or 
labour force exchange, and  
10. statutory provisions in connection with inland public road traffic of vehicles owned by foreign 
citizens.  
In laws or government decrees the legislature may, in respect to specific service activities, prescribe an obligation 
for regis tration and an obligation of preliminary supervision (authorisation) as an exception from the principal rule 
that is the freedom to provide cross -border services. The sectoral rules of the given service activity define which 
service activities are subject to registration and preliminary authorisation.  
The obligation for registration does not represent any restriction in respect to the commencement of service 
provision, as the service provider is entitled to commence the service provision, however, it must b e announced 
to the competent authority (the competent authorities are determined in each case by the sectoral rules). 
Registration for an activity as cross -border provision of services shall be valid for five calendar years from the 
date of registration, u nless the service provider has indicated a shorter period in the application. After expiry the 
registration must be renewed. This does not involve any changes concerning the type of the activity.  
During the validity of the registration, the service provide r may perform the given service activity on an occasional 
basis. The purpose of this provision is that the service provider shall not need to register in each case, if 
they  want to provide cross -border services on an occasional basis only. On the basis of  the registration, the 
authorities can supervise that the activity is actually performed as a cross -border activity and can determine 
whether the other requirements are properly observed.   
In certain cases the legislature prescribes an obligation for autho risation in respect to the cross -border service 
provision. In this case the activity may only be commenced after obtaining the authorisation. An authorisation 
procedure is prescribed as a prerequisite in cases where it is justified by the protection of pub lic order and public 
safety, as well as public health or environmental requirements.  
Cross -border provision of services is regulated by other regulations in cases where the activity is qualified as a 
regulated profession. (A regulated profession is an acti vity which is subject to prescribed qualifications.) In the 
case of regulated professions, these professions are subject to preliminary registration and preliminary 
authorization. The list of such professions, are listed in the Annex to Government Decree 3 3/2008 (21 February) 
on Designating the Authorities Acting in Matters Falling Under Act C of 2001 on the Recognition of Foreign 
Certificates and Degrees, and on the Classification of Services Subject to a Declaration Obligation.

Starting Up in Hungar y 
A sole trader may set up a  sole trader business,  which is a taxpayer without legal personality and which is 
created upon registration in the companies register in accordance with the company registration rules. Sole 
trader companies have legal capacity, and may acquire rights and undertake obligations, and may in particular 
acquire property, conclude agreements, instigate court proceedings and be sued. A sole trader company may 
only have one member, and a natural person may only be a member of one sole tr ader company  
The primary act of law in Hungarian company law is Act 4 of 2006 on Business Associations (Companies Act). 
The main types of business associations under the Companies Act are identical to those regulated in EU 
countries. The procedures on foun ding, implementing changes in data and winding up of Hungarian associations 
are primarily governed by Act V of 2006 on Public Company Information, Company Registration and Winding -up 
Proceedings (Company Procedures Act).  
Under the Companies Act, business a ssociations may be founded by non -resident and resident natural persons, 
legal persons and business associations without legal personality. Hungarian laws do not provide an exhaustive 
list of legal persons but, on the basis of the Civil Code, state, munici pal, business, social and other organisations 
may have legal personalities. International treaties may contain regulations in derogation from these provisions in 
respect of the participation of non -residents in Hungarian business associations.  
The law may require a special permit from the authority for the foundation of a business association (foundation 
permit), such as, for instance, companies with an interest in financing, insurance or capital market activities, 
which may only be founded with approval fr om the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (PSZÁF). Where 
authorisation by the authority is prescribed as mandatory by law to engage in a certain economic activity, the 
business association can be founded and registered but it may only begin and purs ue the activity in question 
when in possession of such authorisation. Activities subject to qualification may only be pursued by business 
associations if there is at least one person among its participating members, employees, or persons working for 
the be nefit of the company under a permanent civil law contract concluded with the business association who 
satisfies the qualification requirements set out in the legal regulations.  
General partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, single  member companies or private 
limited companies may be founded in a simplified procedure by enclosing with the application for the registration 
of the company the deed of foundation drawn up on the basis of a template in the annex of the Company 
Procedures Act. 
STEP 1  
Preparation of corporate documents by a Hungarian attorney -at-law. 
Founders of the company must sign the company's constitutive document, which, together with some other 
documents must be countersigned by a Hungarian attorney).  
Time to complete : minimum one day.  
Costs:  Attorney fees range widely.  
STEP 2  
Opening of a bank account  
Time to complete:  one day.  
Costs:  depending on the bank.  
STEP 3  
Registering the company at the Hungarian Court of Registry and obtaining a tax identification number.  
The company is established by the act of the  court of registration.  All companies and sole trader businesses 
must register at the competent court of regis tration for the company’s registered office. Applications for 
registering or amending details must be submitted  electronically  via a legal representative. The court of 
registration electronically records documents relating to the company and provides an el ectronic certificate of 
registration as well as confirmation of any changes made.  
The "one -stop shop" during company registration means that the Court of Registration obtains the company's tax 
number and statistical code using the electronic system created  for this purpose. The "one -stop shop" in the 
process of registering sole trader activities means that the competent authority obtains the tax number and 
statistical code directly, instead of the applicant, so the applicant does not need to deal in person with the 
competent State tax authority or the Central Statistical Office before registration (for post -hoc registration see the 
section entitled “Tax registration” below).  
Time to complete: in the case of companies established using template constituting d ocuments – one working 
hour from the issue of the company’s tax identification number (NB: this simplified registration procedure is not 
available for public companies limited by shares), otherwise the registration procedure takes 15 working days. It 
shoul d be noted that the process could be more time -consuming if the procedure is suspended because the tax 
authority needs more than one day to provide the court with the tax identification number.  
Costs, registration fees:  
• for limited partnerships: HUF 50,000  (cca: EUR 172);  
• for limited liability companies and for private companies limited by shares: HUF 100,000 (cca. 
EUR 335)  
• for public companies limited by shares: HUF 600,000 (cca: EUR 2,069)  
Simplified registration procedure:  
• for limited liability companies and for private companies limited by shares HUF 50,000 (cca. EUR 
172);  
• for limited partnerships: HUF 25,000 (cca. EUR 86) Publication fees: uniformly HUF 5,000 (cca. 
EUR 17). In the case of the simplified registration proced ure, publication is free of charge.  
In the procedure of company registration legal representation is obligatory.  
Required documents:  
• Instrument of constitution on a standard form  
• Declaration to the Tax Authority to get the company a tax number  
• Authorizatio ns of the legal representative (the counsel), or the certification of the right for 
representation  
• Certificate of payment of administration fees and fee of disclosure  
• List of members  
• Declaration of the CEO not to be subject to forbidding according to Gt. 2 3.§ Certificate of the 
payment service provider for depositing the contribution in cash, as indicated in the instrument of 
constitution or the official declaration of the CEO for giving free run of the pledged contribution in 
cash  
• Declaration of the CEO for giving free run of contribution in -kind as well as the assessment 
declaration of the members concerning the contribution in -kind.  
Applications used in company registration shall be submitted by the legal representative via the Go vernmental 
Portal (magyarorszag.hu), using a general form fill -out framework program ( ÁNYK ) which handles the different 
forms for the process. In the electronic procedure  of company registration it is necessary for the counsel to use 
electronic signature and time stamp.  
Registration (and any other process which requires authorization) by electric means also requires Client Gateway 
(Ügyfélkapu ) registration by the legal representative. The Client Gateway is the electronic identification and 
customer entry system of Hungarian governance. After single -sign-on and authentication of identity, the Client 
Gate allows users to con nect with public bodies, which provide e -government services and administration. The 
legal representatives (counsel) have to convert all records not prepared by themselves (such as copy of property 
deed, authorisation, certification by payment service inst itutions of deposit, etc.) into electronic record. Those 
electronic documents assigned with qualified electronic signatures (QES) can be attached to the application 
directly.  
STEP 4  
Registration with the Hungarian tax authority, municipality, chamber of co mmerce,  the Central 
Administration of National Pension Insurance  
A representative of the company or an authorized tax expert can perform the administration required for the 
registration.  
Time to complete:  one day.  
Costs:  free of charge.  
Taxpayers who are r equired to register their company are also required at the same time to report to the state tax 
authority within 15 days of the submission of the company registration application with regard to information that 
does not appear in the application for compan y registration. Similarly, all taxpayers have an obligation to report to 
the local tax authorities, within 15 days of the commencement of activities there by the taxpayer (e.g. with regard 
to local business taxes).  
Pursuant to the Decree Implementing the A ct on Social Security Pension Provision, the obligation to provide 
information relating to the NYENYI (Individual Pension Insurance Record) form may also be fulfilled through 
electronic administration. The obligation to provide information relating to the Individual Pension Insurance 
Record Form may be fulfilled using the e -NYENYI service of the Central Administration of National Pension 
Insurance.  
STEP 5  
Data provision on employees to the tax authority  
Once they have registered at the Client Gateway, emplo yers are obliged to submit electronically  on the 
Government Portal  the data stipulated by law relating to their employees, on the form drawn up for this purpose, 
for the competent State tax authority of first instance,  by no later than the first day of the  legal insurance 
relationship prior to commencement of employment.  
Important note:  
The fact that a company is registered in the companies register, or that an entrepreneur completes the 
registration required, or receives its operating licence, does not nec essarily mean that it may pursue unrestricted 
business activities. It is a basic condition for legal operation that a company obtain the different licences 
necessary for its activities.  
Many manufacturing and service activities may be pursued on the basis of a simple report, while numerous 
activities require a premises licence. Some commercial activities may be pursued on the basis of an operating 
licence. A number of activities require an activity licence prescribed by  sector specific legislation.

compensation of indemnity claims caused by funeral service activities.  
The amount of the  financial guarantee  is HUF 200,000 when commencing the funeral service activity. Two 
years after commencing the activity, or when a contract is extended, the amount of the financial guarantee will be 
calculated based on the net revenue a ccording to the Act on accounting

compliance with the food safety, food quality, animal feed safety and animal feed quality regulations, it is to be 
presumed that the distributor should or may have recognised the defect that excludes placement on the market.

report.  
The food chain safety directorate verifies forthwith upon the receipt of the report whether the report filed conforms 
to the requirements under su bstantive law and, within eight days of the receipt of the report, at the latest,  
1. if the report conforms to the requirements and the procedural duty has been paid, notifies the 
filer of the report thereof by sending a certificate;  
2. if the report does not co nform to the requirements or the procedural duty has not been paid, 
states the deficiencies identified in the report and warns the service provider of the legal 
consequences of engagement in such activities without reporting.  
If the report filed conforms to the requirements and the procedural duty has been paid, the food chain 
safety directorate sends a certificate which contains the following:  
1. name of proceeding authority, filing number of report and name of case officer,  
2. name  and address of service provider, or head office in the case of an organisation,  
3. description of reported services,

Food businesses are required to pay the general proced ural duty, that is, HUF 3,000, for the procedure. The duty 
must be paid upon the filing of the report, in the form of duty stamps adhered to the document containing the 
report.  
If, in addition to the home delivery of catering products, the client also wish es to engage in other commercial 
activities tied to a licence or reporting, it may submit all reports and licence requests to the trade authority (clerk) 
at the same time. In this case, the trade authority proceeds in the procedure as a participating autho rity and 
contacts the authorities with competence and jurisdiction itself. Simultaneously with the submission of the request 
for a licence, the client may also report any other commercial activities and may pay the relevant duties to the 
food inspection au thority. The food inspection authority forwards such reports to the trade authority forthwith. In 
the above cases, the client need not contact the other authorities with competence and jurisdiction for the 
purpose of the institution of the relevant proceed ings.  
A food business with a licence must forthwith report any change  
1. in the name of the food business,  
2. in the address (head office) of the food business,  
3. in the place of the food retail activities, and  
4. in the foodstuffs intended to be retailed  
to the food  inspection authority.  
In the case of a change in the place of the food retail activities and the foodstuffs intended to be retailed, a new 
licensing procedure must be conducted which is governed by the rules relating to the licensing procedure. In 
other i nstances, the food inspection authority issues a new licence and enters the relevant changes in its 
records.   
A food business providing its services as cross -border services must forthwith report any change in the data 
reported after the initial reporting to the food chain safety directorate.  
The food chain safety directorate enters the changes in the data as reported in its records. The service provider 
may report changes to the authority in person, verbally or in writing, or by mail in writing. If no new licence is 
required, no duty or fee is payable for the reporting of changes.  
Food businesses are required to pay a supervisory fee annually to the food chain supervisory authority in the 
interest of covering the costs of the fulfilment of its tasks related  to its supervisory activities in the capacity of food 
chain authority. Unless the food business is obliged to pay a supervisory fee at a fixed rate, food businesses with 
the obligation to submit returns are required to keep records which clearly permit th e calculation of the base and 
rate of the supervisory fee payable to the authority.  
As a rule of thumb, the rate of the supervisory fee is  
1. 0.1% of the net sales revenue in the previous year, or  
2. 0.1% of the income in the previous year in the case of a natur al person obliged to submit a 
personal income tax return,  
derived by the food business obliged to pay a supervisory fee from the distribution of foodstuffs, not including any 
excise duty and public hygiene product duty.  
In the case of food businesses required to pay a supervisory fee which only sell foodstuffs to final consumers, the 
rate of the supervisory fee is  
1. twenty thousand Hungarian forints annually in the case of micro -businesses and small 
producers;  
2. seven hundred  thousand Hungarian forints annually in the case of small businesses.  
At the same time, small food businesses may, at their discretion, also declare and pay the supervisory fee in 
accordance with the general rules.  
Agricultural small producers are exempt f rom the obligation to submit returns and to pay the supervisory fee in 
respect of their activities as primary producers.  
Food businesses obliged to pay the supervisory fee must, once annually, declare their net sales revenues or 
incomes as the basis for th e payment of the fee. This obligation must be met by 31 May. Payment of the fee does 
not substitute for the obligation of declaring the relevant sales revenue or income. The supervisory fee need not 
be paid if its rate does not reach one thousand Hungarian  forints.  
Food businesses obliged to pay the supervisory fee are required to pay the annual supervisory fee in two equal 
instalments, by 31 July and 31 January. A default penalty must be paid on any supervisory fee not paid by the 
deadline; the default pen alty is governed by the provisions of Act XCII of 2003 on Taxation (hereinafter referred 
to as the „Taxation Act”). Any unpaid supervisory fee and default penalty qualify as public debts to be collected 
as taxes.

Accommodation services must, on an ongoing basis, satisfy the licensing and operating requirements discussed 
herein below; it is not sufficient to verify the fulfilment of these requirements s olely during the course of the 
licensing procedure and the relevant authority may at any time investigate the ongoing fulfilment of these 
requirements.  
A camp site is a type of accommodation facility solely created on the given premises for the purposes of  
accommodation services where separate plots (plot units) and/or bungalows are provided for guests and their 
vehicles for accommodation purposes (hereinafter collectively referred to as „accommodation unit”) as well as 
other service facilities are made ava ilable (for instance, bathroom units for the purposes of cleaning, laundry, 
cooking and general hygiene, reception service, etc.). A camp site must have minimum nine accommodation 
units.  
Camping services may be provided in an area which is fenced off and i s dust -free, where there is precipitation

accommodation services are also provided in bungalows on the premises of the camp site, the number of guests 
that may be put up in bungalows must be disregarded upon the calculation of compliance with th e following 
criteria in respect of items which are available in such bungalows. In the case of operation throughout the year,

consent,  
3. in the case of an accommodation facility in joint ownership, if not all co -owners proceed as 
accommodation providers, deed verifying co -owners’ consent, and duties payable for the 
procedure paid in the form of duty stamps.  
A variety of techni cal authorities participate in the procedure instituted for the issuance of an accommodation 
licence. The service provider intending to operate the accommodation facility need not contact these authorities; 
the authority conducting the licensing procedure contacts them. However, in combination with the duty payable 
for the licensing procedure, the client must also pay the duties for the proceedings of these authorities, and 
payment of these duties must be verified in the course of the submission of the requ est. There is no scope for 
requesting the preliminary position of the technical authorities in the proceedings; at the same time, the 
processing time limit available to such technical authorities is included in the general processing time limit.  
If request ed by the accommodation provider in its request, the clerk provides for the organisation of an on -site 
inspection with the attendance of the proceeding authorities. The purpose of this inspection is to accelerate the 
procedure as far as possible. In the co urse of the procedure, the clerk obtains the details of the owners and 
beneficiaries of the accommodation property and the title sheet for the verification of title to the property ex 
officio, either by contacting the real estate authority or by accessing the computerised real estate records, which 
must be enclosed with the request.  
The clerk is required to assess the request within the general processing time limit of 30 days; the clerk may 
extend this time limit on a single occasion by 30 days. The author ities have 15 days to issue their respective 
positions; this time limit is, however, included in the above processing time limit.  
If the request and also the accommodation facility meet the statutory requirements, the clerk issues a licence for 
the operati on of the accommodation facility. Simultaneously with granting the licence, the clerk issues a separate 
certificate in verification thereof for the service provider.  
A general procedural duty, that is, HUF 3,000 must be paid for the clerk’s procedure. A ge neral procedural duty 
of the amount of HUF 3,000 must also be paid to each of the participating authorities. The duties must be paid at 
the time of the submission of the request in the form of duty stamps adhered to the request.  
In the course of the licens ing procedure or, in the case of „silence is consent”, upon the expiry of the processing 
time limit, the clerk registers the accommodation facility and the service provider ex officio. The clerk posts all 
data featured in the records he/she keeps on the In ternet.  
After the issuance of the accommodation licence, the accommodation provider must forthwith report to the clerk 
any change in the data stated in the licence request in writing. No duty or fee is payable in conjunction with the 
fulfilment of this rep orting obligation.  
The accommodation provider must report the closure of the accommodation facility to the clerk within eight days 
of closure, subject to the simultaneous submission of the relevant certificate.  
If the accommodation provider wishes to engag e in other commercial activities tied to a licence on the premises 
of the same accommodation facility, simultaneously with the submission of the request for a licence for the 
accommodation facility, the requests with respect to any such further licences ma y also be submitted to the clerk. 
In this case, the clerk proceeds in the proceedings instituted for the issuance of such further licences for other 
commercial activities tied to a licence as a participating authority. The data, requests and enclosures nec essary 
for such separate licences must also be submitted with the request and the relevant duties and administrative 
fees must be paid as well. However, if all the documents are fully submitted and the conditions prescribed for 
such separate licences are s atisfied, the client need not contact other authorities.  
SERVICE PROVISION ACTIVITIES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF CROSS BORDER SERVICE PROVISION  
With regard to the fact that the provision of accommodation services is based on the presumed existence of an 
accommoda tion facility, the cross -border provision of services is effectively out of the question in the case of 
these services. Accordingly, if a person residing or registered in Hungary, in another State of the European 
Economic Area or in a third country wishes to provide accommodation services in Hungary, he/she may do so 
under the same conditions, based on a licence issued by the clerk.

Operation of Fairs and Markets  
A fair shall mean a building, a building complex or a territory, where, in general, several persons carry out 
seasonal retail activity or occasional retail activities in connection with specific events or calendar days. A market, 
on the other hand, is a bu ilding, a building complex or a territory, where several persons carry out retail activities 
daily or occasionally on a weekly basis. It is essential to make a difference between the facility manager and 
operator of a fair or a market:  
The facility manager  is the owner, tenant or any other user of a territory or real estate used as a fair or a market, 
who provides the market area for those carrying out commercial activities at the fair or market; furthermore, the 
facility manager is responsible for the comm ercial service activities provided for those carrying out commercial 
activities at the fair or market. The operator, on the other hand, is the facility manager, or a person appointed by 
the facility manager, to manage or operate the fair or market, or to p erform other duties related to operation. The 
operator is entitled to act on behalf of the facility manager.

entitlement to operation.  
The operator determines the procedures for the operation of the fair or market and informs the sellers and 
customers on such procedures in a notice displayed in a well -visible place. Furthermore, the operator’s name, 
address, seat and e -mail address (if any) shall also be indicated in the notice. In case of fairs and markets, the 
notice shall also c ontain the order of reservations and booths, in accordance with the professional standards.  
The operator determines the opening hours of the fair or market between 05:00 a.m. and 08:00 p.m. Opening 
hours after 08:00 p.m. may be licensed by the clerk of the  local municipality upon consultation with the competent 
police station. The operator is obliged to inform the customers on the opening hours of the fair or market.  
In case of fairs and markets, the operator must provide the shops, booths and other establi shments developed 
for purposes other than selling with serial numbers in a well -visible way for the customers. In case of a 
permanent fair or market, at the entrance of the fair or market, the operator shall install a board containing a site 
map or layout of the fair or market, indicating the current arrangement of the commercial units and booths with 
the relevant serial numbers.

set out in the decisions made by the au thorities. Furthermore, the operator is obliged to proceed as prescribed by 
the authorities and to co -operate during authority inspections.  
The operator is obliged to investigate any written complaints filed in respect of his activity and inform the 
custom er on his measures and the justification for his measures by regular mail or e -mail within thirty days after 
receipt of the complaint. In the reply, the customer must be informed on his or her right to apply to the clerk of the 
municipality if he or she do es not approve the reply.  
Fairs and markets may only be established and operated in consideration of the general zoning plan of a 
settlement, on sites where no harmful environmental pollution endangers the individuals, foods or food raw 
materials. The fair  and market sites must be established at dust - and mud -free places that can be cleaned easily. 
The territories of daily food markets and large food markets must be paved with an easily cleanable cover. The 
floor of market halls must be provided with a firm , anti -slip cover without gaps, which can be properly cleaned and 
disinfected, and a drainage system satisfying the standard construction requirements must also be installed for

The supply of fairs and markets with a sufficient volume of water with drinking water quality must be ensured. 
Water take -off points must be created in an appropriate arrangement in order that even the most distant parts of 
the fair o r market can be reached for cleaning. The water take -off points developed for cleaning must be provided

sellers.  
The territories of fairs, markets and market halls must be kept clean continuously during the opening hours, and 
after the closure a general cleaning must be carried out. In case of a territory with publ ic utilities, the emerging 
wastewater must be drained through the public drainage system. If there is no public drainage system, the 
generated wastewater must be collected in a closed sewage water container.  
At fairs, markets and in market halls, waste and  refuse collecting containers which can be easily washed and

The car park for the sellers’  vehicles must be developed outside the fair or market.  
Should selling from a vehicle or a mobile shop be permitted on the fair or market, a separated territory shall be 
designated for this purpose. In this case, drinking water, drainage and proper waste c ollection must be ensured 
for occasional mobile shops and vendors at the fair or market.

land registry office or from the computer -based real estate registration system.  
Specialized authorities shall also act in procedures for fair or market operational licences. The service provider 
who wants to operate the fair or market does not need to apply to such authorities, because it is the authority 
proceeding in the licensing procedure that is responsible for this. However, the client shall pay the duties payable 
for th e specialized authority’s procedure, together with the duties payable for the licensing procedure, that before 
filing the application, and certify payment of such duties when the application is filed.

No duties or fees are payable for the fulfilment of this obligation.  
SERVICE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK O F CROSS -BORDER SERVICE 
PROVISION  
As the operation of a market necessitates a regular, actual, permanent and long -lasting business activity, which 
is carried out through an establishment, premises, office, shop or other place, or fixed equipment or devices,  
operation of a market may only be carried out by way of permanent local presence, and this activity, by definition, 
cannot be carried out as a cross -border service activity.  
Fairs, however, may be organized as cross -border service activities without perma nent local presence, in a 
temporary or occasional manner. In this case, as no other regulations apply either at the level of statutory 
provisions or government decrees, cross -border fairs can be operated by any service provider settled in another 
EEA Membe r State and legally carrying out service activities there, furthermore no license, notification on the 
commencement of the service activity, certificate, authority certificate or card is required for the operation.  
This means that if a service provider is entitled to hold a fair, or to provide any other similar service in any EEA 
Member State, this service provider may theoretically hold an occasional or single fair in Hungary without any 
licence. Note, however, that the absence of the licensing obligation does not exempt the operator of the 
occasional or single fair from complying with the provisions of the Hungarian substantive law. Accordingly, 
infringement of the Hungarian substantive law shall involve measures of the Hungarian authorities, who will 
proceed against this service provider in the same way as against operators licensed in Hungary. Nevertheless, 
the clerk in charge of the supervision of such service has no right to proceed against such service provider alone 
with reference to the absence of li cence.

the same time, the applicant shall have to pay the duty for the procedure of competent authorities together with 
the duty for the licensing procedure, and shall be requested to prove paym ent of such duties when submitting the 
application.  
The authority shall notify the applicant about the start of the licensing procedure. If the accommodation provider

the termination, and shall return the certificate. The town clerk shall revoke the licence immediately after the 
report and shall deregister the acc ommodation.  
If the accommodation provider intends to pursue any other licence -bound commercial activity at the place of the 
accommodation, he or she  may submit to the town clerk an application for a separate licence together with the 
application for the ac commodation provider licence. In such a case, the town clerk shall act as a cooperating

also be paid. If the above documents are submitted without deficiencies and all the requirem ents prescribed for 
the separate licence are met, the applicant is not required to contact any other authority.  
  
 
CROSS BORDER SERVICE PROVISION   
Guest houses may only pursue accommodation providing activity in possession of an accommodation provider 
licence issued by the town clerk competent over the area of location of the accom modation. As the existence of 
the place of accommodation is a prerequisite for the accommodation providing activity, it is practically impossible 
to pursue this activity as a cross -border service. Consequently, any person living or registered in Hungary or  
another state of the European Economic Area or a third country may engage in the accommodation providing 
activity under the same conditions, with the authorisation of the town clerk.

NATIONAL AVOWAL  
WE, THE MEMBERS OF THE HUNGARIAN NATION, at the beginning of the new 
millennium, with a sense of responsibility for every Hungarian, hereby proclaim the 
following:  
We are proud that our king Saint Stephen built the Hungarian State on solid ground and 
made our country a part of Christian Europe one thousand years ago.  
We are proud of our forebears who fought for the survival, freedom and independence of 
our country.  
We are p roud of the outstanding intellectual achievements of the Hungarian people.  
We are proud that our nation has over the centuries defended Europe in a series of struggles 
and enriched Europe’s common values with its talent and diligence.  
We recognise the role  of Christianity in preserving nationhood. We value the various 
religious traditions of our country.  
We promise to preserve  our nation’s intellectual and spiritual unity , torn apart in the storms 
of the last century.  
We proclaim that the national minori ties living with us form part of the Hungarian political 
community and are constituent parts of the State.  
We commit ourselves to promoting and safeguarding our heritage, our unique language, 
Hungarian culture  and the languages and cultures of national  minorities living in Hungary, 
along with all man -made and natural assets of the Carpathian Basin. We bear responsibility 
for our descendants  and therefore we shall protect the living conditions of future generations 
by making prudent use of our material, inte llectual and natural resources.  
We believe that our national culture is a rich contribution to the diversity of European unity.  
We respect the freedom and culture of other nations, and shall strive to cooperate with all 
nations of the world.  
We hold that h uman existence is based on human dignity.  
We hold that individual freedom can only be complete in cooperation with others.  
We hold that the family and the nation constitute the principal framework of our 
coexistence, and that our fundamental cohesive values are loyalty , faith and love.  
We hold that the strength of a community and the honour of each person are based on 
labour  and the  achievement of the human mind.  
We hold that we have a general duty to help the vulnerable and the poor.  
We hold that the common goal of citizens and the State is to achieve the highest possible 
measure of well -being, safety, order, justice and liber ty. 
We hold that democracy is only possible where the State serves its citizens and handles their 
affairs in an equitable manner, without abuse  and impartially . 
We honour the achievements of our historic constitution and we honour the Holy Crown, 
which embodies the constitutional continuity of Hungary’s statehood and the unity of the 
nation.  
We hold that the protection of our identity rooted in our historic constitution is a 
fundamental obligation of the State.

Contact: eu-forditas@im.gov.hu  We do not recognise the suspension of our h istoric constitution due to foreign occupations. 
We deny any statute of limitations for the inhuman crimes committed against the Hungarian 
nation and its citizens under the national socialist and the communist dictatorship.  
We do not recognise the communis t constitution of 1949, since it was the basis for 
tyrannical rule; we therefore proclaim it to be invalid.  
We agree with the Members of the first free National Assembly, which proclaimed as its 
first decision that our current liberty was born of our 1956 Revolution.  
We date the restoration of our country’s self -determination, lost on the nineteenth day of 
March 1944, from the second day of May 1990, when the first freely elected organ of popular 
representation was formed. We shall consider this date to be the beginning of our country’s 
new democracy and constitutional order.  
We hold that after the decades of the twentieth century, which led to a state of moral decay, 
we have an abiding need for spiritual and intellectual renewal.  
We trust in a jointly -shape d future and the commitment of younger generations. We believe 
that our children and grandchildren will make Hungary great again with their talent, 
persistence and moral strength.  
Our Fundamental Law shall be the basis of our legal order; it shall be an al liance among 
Hungarians of the past, present and future. It is a living framework which expresses the 
nation’s will and the form in which we want to live.  
We, the citizens of Hungary, are ready to found the order of our country upon the common 
endeavours o f the nation.

2/Introduction & Legal S ystem
Legal & court system
Hungary is an independent, democratic, constitutional state. Under its Fundamental Law,
Hungary is a parliamentary republic, meaning that its executive, legislative and judicature
branches are separate.
The main and highest law of Hungary is the Fundamental Law. The Fundamental Law of
Hungary regulates two classic constitutional areas: state administration (national and local
government and organisations for the protection of rights) and citizens' basic rights.
Hungary has a civil law system. In addition to the Fundamental Law, there are acts of Par-
liament, governmental and ministerial decrees (which are valid only if published in the Official
Gazette), and decrees of local governments (which also need to be published). Hungary be-
came a Member State of the European Union on 1 May 2004.
The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches. The highest court
in the Hungarian court system is the Curia. First-instance jurisdiction in most matters rests
with local courts, effecting the principle that the majority of cases should be settled at a local
level within the easiest reach of the parties. Operating parallel to the local courts are the pub-
lic administration and labour courts, specialising in the revision of decisions of public authori-
ties and those arising in labour disputes. Appeals against the decisions of local courts may be
submitted to higher courts (regional courts and regional courts of appeal) acting as appellate
courts. In certain cases specified by law, however, regional courts act as the court of first in-
stance. The territorial competence of the local and regional courts is determined by (and iden-
tical to) the areas of public administration. The right of remedy is ensured in the Hungarian ju-
risdiction. The regional courts of appeal hear the appeals lodged against decisions of local and
regional courts. There are five regional courts of appeal throughout the country – in Budapest,
Szeged, Pécs, Debrecen and Győr. Taking over the task of examining appeals, the regional 
courts of appeal have significantly reduced the backlog of cases in the Curia. As a result, the
Curia can now concentrate on its main function of ensuring the uniform application of law and
examining applications for the review of final judgments. Extraordinary remedy is also en-
sured in certain cases; if there is no further right to appeal, the parties have the right to an ex-
traordinary remedy such as the review of the judgment of lower level courts by the Curia
based on violation of the law.
Governmental system
The President holds the highest office in Hungary. He is elected by Parliament every five
years. Although he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he has a largely ceremonial
role.
Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the unicameral Parliament which
consists of 199 members elected by a one-round election system, which replaces the previous
3two-round system. Since the most recent elections (April 2014), Parliament has once again
been dominated by the conservative Fidesz party, with a two-thirds majority.
As the Hungarian political system is parliamentary, the Government is held accountable
by the Parliament. Parliament monitors the Government, and if it concludes that the Govern-
ment is not discharging its responsibilities satisfactorily, it may withdraw its support for it
through a constructive vote of no confidence.
The Government is the most important organ of executive power and the chief controller
of public administration. The Government has the right through the competent branch minis-
ters to freely replace any public officer or governmental officer. This means that it implements
decisions made by the Parliament, as the legislative organ, and pursues the goals laid out in
the Government's programme (adhering to the Government's pre-formulated programmes of
the Government).
The Hungarian Government comprises the Prime Minister and government ministers. The
Prime Minister is the head of the Government. The Prime Minister is elected by the Parlia-
ment following a proposal from the President. At the same time, the Parliament votes on the
Government's programme. The Prime Minister has to determine the general direction of Gov-
ernment policy within the context of the Government's programme. The President appoints
ministers according to the Prime Minister's recommendations. In addition, the Prime Minister
chairs cabinet meetings and ensures the implementation of Government decisions.
The Prime Minister may nominate one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, chosen from
among the ministers. At present there are two Deputy Prime Ministers who carry out specific
tasks in addition to deputising for the Prime Minister in certain situations he has specified.
One of these Deputy Prime Ministers is responsible for the structure of public administration
and its efficient operation, while the other coordinates and manages national policy and
church affairs on a permanent basis.
A large part of a minister's work is taken up with guiding and supervising a given ministry
(being a Government department). It is the task of a minister to develop statutory proposals
to promote effective operation within the minister's specialist area of responsibility and to
implement the Government’s programme. They must also represent the Hungarian Govern-
ment at the European Council or other international organisations.
Public administration operates efficiently when policy and traditional public administra-
tion tasks are separate. This is reflected in the new structure of public administration where a
state secretary acts as a deputy for a minister, with full delegated ministerial powers for a giv-
en specialist department. Each minister can be responsible for several departments: for ex-
ample one minister is responsible for education, sport and healthcare.
Ministers of state are divided into three categories: state secretaries responsible for spe-
cial areas (e.g. education); state secretaries responsible for administrative tasks; and parlia-
mentary ministers of state. State secretaries responsible for special areas are political leaders,
while the posts of public administration and parliamentary state secretaries are politically
neutral, as is the post of Deputy Minister of State. A public administration state secretary is a
4specialist leader of a ministry's organisational operations, while the responsibilities of a par-
liamentary state secretary are towards Parliament.
Policy approach
Hungary is the only country in Central and Eastern Europe where all governments have
been able to fulfil their four-year mandate with no interim elections.
In 1989, Hungary started its reintegration into the world economy. The country opened
up to direct foreign investments and liberalised its trade regime. Privatisation began and was
almost finished by the second half of the 1990s. Hungary joined the OECD in 1996 and NATO
in 1999.
Over the past 25 years, conservative and social-liberal governments have alternately been
in power. At the last parliamentary elections in April 2014, the conservative FIDESZ-Hungarian
Civil Alliance ( FIDESZ-MPSZ ) won with a majority. Apart from Fidesz in 2010, no single party
has had a two-thirds mandate since Hungary's transition to democracy 25 years ago. Fidesz's
central key goals have been to reform the system of local governments, the electoral system
and media law, and it aims to ease the process for Hungarian nationals in neighbouring coun-
tries to obtain dual citizenship.
Hungary offers a number of benefits and incentives for new investors as well as for com-
panies already active in the country. Generally, investors qualify for incentives when they sur-
pass a certain investment value or number of jobs created.
The Hungarian taxation system is now close to the level of complexity found in Western
Europe. Tax laws in Hungary are enacted by Parliament and the tax authority provides inter-
pretative and administrative guidelines for these laws. Court decisions play an increasing role
in interpreting tax laws and, as a result of Hungary's accession to the EU, European Court of
Justice case law is also applicable.
Hungarian tax is paid by self-assessment. All taxpayers have to register, determine their
tax obligations, make payments in advance, file tax returns on their own behalf, make correc-
tions to the tax returns as needed, keep records and supply information as required by law.
Authorities randomly examine tax returns to keep track of the self-assessment system. Corpo-
rations are subject to continuous assessment throughout the year. The Head of the National
Tax and Customs Authority ( NAV ) determines the target audit areas for the tax authority in
the tax year concerned. The tax year is the calendar year for individuals and the calendar year
or the financial year for companies (the financial year of companies varies from the calendar
year only in limited cases). In general, tax returns must be filed annually. For VAT, payroll and
withholding taxes, however, quarterly or monthly filings may be required.
Central taxes:
 Corporate income tax
 VAT
 Personal income tax
5Local taxes:
 Building tax
 Land tax
 Communal tax
 Local business tax
Tax-related incentives:
 Development tax allowance
 R&D-related tax benefits
6/Foreign Investment Policy
Hungary is one of the most developed countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Many for-
eign investors have become active in Hungary since the beginning of the 1990s. As a result,
modern industrial facilities and moderate incomes have created an attractive economic mar-
ket with a high export potential. Here the companies with a Western European or overseas
domicile also profit from Hungary's strategic location as a "bridge to Eastern Europe".
About one third of the country's foreign investments continue to originate from large and
medium-sized companies, especially from the automobile and engineering industries in Ger-
many. The Hungarian Government is building on its traditional strengths which include the
training of specialists for technical products and IT. A wide range of concepts are being used
to encourage foreign companies within these industries to invest in Hungary.
Within the state aid legal framework of the EU, the Hungarian Government supports in-
vestment projects with a one-stop-shop service including "VIP treatment" and comprehensive
information about available subsidies for investment projects. The current structure of the
governmental bodies coping with the support of foreign investors is coordinated by the Minis-
ter of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and include various types of organisations involved in the
promotion of investment, such as investment banks, trading and investment promotion agen-
cies.
Regarding the available incentives, it should be noted that Hungary is entitled to approx-
imately€40 billion from EU funds during the period of 2014–2020, 60% of which will be spent
on developing the Hungarian economy and focusing on R&D&I projects and investments of
SMEs, according to the Government's plans. Beside EU funds, there are nationally funded sub-
sidies as well, aiming to support investment projects creating new workplaces and targeting
training projects to assure the availability of a well-educated workforce.
7/Types of Business V ehicles
Forms of business vehicle
Foreign investors prefer (in the majority of cases) to establish limited liability companies
for the purposes of starting their business activities in Hungary. The main characteristics of
the relevant limited liability corporate forms are described below.
In Hungary, limited liability companies can either be a "Kft." (company limited by quotas;
hereinafter Kft.), a public company ( Nyrt ., stock company, not described in this summary) or a
private company limited by shares ( Zrt.). For international operations, it is also possible to es-
tablish a European Company ( Societas Europaea ) with its registered office in Hungary, based
on the conditions prescribed by the rules of the relevant European Union regulation.
Relevant vehicle
The limited liability company form is preferred, as its members/shareholders (with certain
exceptions) are only liable for the company's losses to the extent of their contributions.
From the available corporate forms it is generally easier to establish a "company limited
by quotas" (see description below).
Registration formalities
After signing the necessary documentation, the company must be registered in the trade
register by the competent court of registration. This procedure is administered by a lawyer or
a notary public.
Although it is possible to sign the formation documents outside Hungary, all the docu-
ments would need to be signed in front of a notary public and, in certain cases, an apostille al-
so needs to be attached. If the documents are signed in Hungary, the involvement of a notary
public is not required and lawyers may countersign documents.
A Kft. or Zrt. may be incorporated using an ordinary procedure or a simplified procedure,
whereas a stock company (Nyrt.) can only be incorporated with admission to the Budapest
Stock Exchange via traditional public offering from a Zrt.
The simplified procedure is significantly faster and cheaper but the founders are not free
to decide on the contents of the company's articles of association. The founders are free to
draft the articles under the ordinary procedure.
Ordinary procedure Simplified procedure
Registration costs HUF 105 ,000 HUF 50 ,000
Timescale 15 business days after
filing the application1 working hour (+ 1 day
should be taken into ac-
8count)
A company is legally established only upon registration in the Hungarian trade register,
but it may conduct certain activities (as a pre-company) from the date of foundation, i.e. from
the time of countersigning of the executed version of the articles of association by the attor-
ney preparing the formation documents. However, any activities that are subject to prior au-
thorisation (e.g. the commencement of any financial services related activities) cannot be
conducted in the pre-company phase.
The Kft. has a lower capital requirement (minimum registered capital: HUF 3,000,000),
while the Zrt. may only be established with a minimum capital of HUF 5,000,000, and the Nyrt.
with HUF 20,000,000. Registered capital can be freely increased, i.e. no statutory maximum is
applicable in this respect.
Members' contributions of capital can be provided either in cash or in kind, or as a com-
bination of the two.
The quotas of a Kft. and the shares of a Zrt./Nyrt. may be freely transferred or encum-
bered unless a shareholders' agreement or the articles provide otherwise.
A Nyrt. or Zrt. can issue preference shares which may grant different preferential rights to
the shareholders. The possibility to issue preferential shares may be an advantage for foreign
investors planning to acquire shares in a Hungarian entity.
On the other hand, the issue of preferential business quotas is not possible in the case of
Kfts. It is, however, theoretically possible to attach different rights to different types of quotas
in the Kft.'s articles of association.
With regard to a Kft., if not otherwise stipulated or precluded in the articles of associa-
tion, the members and then the company (in this sequence) have a pre-emption right, i.e. of-
fers must first be made to existing quotaholders in connection to the quotas being transferred
to a third party. It is also possible to set out pre-emption rights in relation to the shares in the
case of a Zrt.

Members' (shareholders') meeting
The members'/shareholders' meeting is the highest decision-making body of a Kft. and
Zrt./Nyrt. and consists of the company's members/shareholders. Special rules apply with re-
gard to "single-member/shareholder" companies (see below).
A simple majority vote of the members'/shareholders' meeting is sufficient in most cases.
For some matters, however, a 75% majority is required by law (e.g. for changing the articles of
association). The articles of association may specify certain matters where the mem-
bers/shareholders may decide without holding a members’/shareholders' meeting, as well as
the method of decision. The articles may also allow the holding of members'/shareholders'
meetings by means of electronic communications.
The Kft. and Zrt. may also operate as a single-member/shareholder company. In this case,
the single member/shareholder exercises the decision-making rights of the mem-
10bers'/shareholders' by passing written resolutions. In addition, the single mem-
ber/shareholder may directly instruct the management.
There are no restrictions with respect to foreign members/shareholders.
Management
The management of a Kft. is carried out by one or more managing directors (i.e. the single
managing directors act on their own).
In the case of an Nyrt., a board of directors consisting of three or more members must be
set up. A Zrt. must be operated by a single director or by a board of directors (three or more
members).
The appointed directors may be authorised to sign on behalf of the company solely or
jointly with other directors.
Directors carry out their duties independently, meaning that their activities are governed
only by law, the articles of association and the previous members'/shareholders' resolutions.
This also means that directors may not be instructed concerning their management activities
(with the exception of single-member/shareholder companies).
The articles may, however, provide that certain decisions may only be made subject to
the prior consent of the members'/shareholders' meeting (or the supervisory board). It should
be noted that these restrictions on representation incorporated in the articles of association
only bind the directors and the members/shareholders, i.e. the restrictions are not effective
towards third parties (e.g. prior authorisation of the members' meeting may be required to
conclude agreements above a certain contractual value limit).
Officers of companies may hold any nationality.
Directors' liability
Directors must carry out their activities with due care and in the interests of the compa-
ny. Directors are jointly and severally liable to the members/shareholders for their acts and
omissions. In certain cases, directors may also have liability towards the creditors of the com-
pany if, in the event of a liquidation procedure, the company does not have sufficient assets
to satisfy its creditors.
The new Civil Code kept the previously adopted regulations introducing new statutory
provisions excluding a person who has been an executive or member of an insolvent or phan-
tom company from being an executive in a new business entity.
Parent company liability
A parent company's liability is generally limited to its capital contribution. However, there
are certain important exceptions such as:
 if a company which is controlled by a dominant member (holding at least 75% of the vot-
ing rights in the company) is going into liquidation, the dominant member has to bear un-
11limited liability for all liabilities of the company that are not covered by its assets (provid-
ed that the court has declared the unlimited and full liability of the dominant member re-
sponsible due to its history of making unfavourable business decisions in the debtor com-
pany) and
 if the company is liquidated, the members/shareholders who have abused their limited li-
ability or the company's legal personality to the detriment of creditors must bear unlim-
ited, joint and several liability for the unsatisfied obligations of the liquidated company
(e.g. where risky, speculative business were conducted through the limited liability com-
pany, the members may not rely on their limited liability in all situations).
Effective as of 1 March 2012, regulations introduced new statutory provisions excluding
anybody who has been an executive or member of an insolvent or phantom company from
acquiring a majority share (50% + 1) in a new company.
Reporting obligation
Companies must file their annual balance sheets with the competent authorities by
31 May of each year. This balance sheet is publicly available.
Companies must fulfil certain disclosure and reporting requirements of the court of regis-
tration following any changes in the corporate data included in the trade register (e.g. any
amendments to the articles of association, directors, members of the supervisory board, etc.).
Details for opening a branch office or representative office
A branch office is a business unit (without legal personality) through which the following
entities may operate in Hungary: foreign legal persons (i.e. companies), foreign organisations
without legal personality and other foreign-registered businesses.
A branch office comes into existence when the relevant court of registration registers the
branch office in the trade register. Prior to its registration in the trade register, the branch of-
fice may not engage in any activities which require official authorisation and/or the conduct of
which requires a licence (including activities relating to the purchase and lease of business
premises).
The branch office may be represented by persons who (i) are employed by or are as-
signed to the branch office or (ii) have resident status in Hungary and have concluded a con-
tract for services (i.e. a civil law contract) with the branch office.
The court of registration must process the branch office registration application within 15
working days.
A Hungarian commercial representative office ( CRO ) is a business unit of a foreign enter-
prise (founder) without its own legal personality, like a branch.
Business activities may not be conducted through a CRO; therefore the scope of its activi-
ties is significantly limited. A CRO may only act as an intermediary in the negotiation of con-
tracts, participate in the preparation of contracts and carry out informational, marketing and
12promotional activities on behalf of its founder and no other activities (i.e. in general, a branch
office can be seen as an independent economic unit, whilst a CRO cannot).
A CRO comes into existence when the relevant court of registration registers the CRO in
the trade register. The CRO may only commence its operations and engage in legally permit-
ted activities following its registration in the trade register.
The CRO may be represented by persons who (i) are employed by or are assigned to the
CRO or (ii) have resident status in Hungary and have concluded a contract for services (i.e. a
civil law contract) with the CRO. The persons employed by the CRO are deemed to be in a le-
gal relationship with the CRO's founder.
The court of registration must process the CRO registration application within 15 working
days.
Information for listing on local stock exchange
The regulation and operation of the capital market in Hungary is supervised by the Hun-
garian National Bank ( HNB ) (Magyar Nemzeti Bank ). The stock market operator authorised by
the HNB is the Budapest Stock Exchange ( Budapesti Értéktőzsde).
Listing equity on the Budapest Stock Exchange requires several steps. Its complexity and
timeline also depends on the "type" of listing the company requires:
 "Simple" listing on the Budapest Stock Exchange is where there is no capital increase (i.e.
issue of new shares) and no public offering of existing shares
 "Traditional public offering" is admission to the Budapest Stock Exchange together with
the offer of shares to the public, i.e. either the issue of new shares or sale by owners or a
combination of the two.
As a general rule, the admission of securities to trading on a regulated market must be
made following the preparation of a prospectus. The prospectus must contain all relevant in-
formation on the economic, market, financial and legal position of the company, giving inves-
tors the widest possible range of information. A prospectus prepared for a listing on the Bu-
dapest Stock Exchange must be submitted to the Hungarian National Bank for prior approval.
As a consequence of Hungary's EU membership and on the basis of a "single passport", the
Budapest Stock Exchange also accepts prospectuses approved by a supervisory authority of
any other EU Member State.
An application for listing must be submitted to the Budapest Stock Exchange, which must
review the application and make a decision within 30 calendar days of receipt. Various docu-
ments must be published at least two trading days before the listing on the official site for
publications of the Budapest Stock Exchange, such as the prospectus, constitutional docu-
ments, the ownership structure and the details of the registrar of shares, etc.
Listing of equity securities will fall under one of three categories, "A", "B" or "T". A cate-
gory "B" listing requires the basic legal requirements to be fulfilled. However, a category "A"
listing has additional requirements, and while the admission is stricter, category "A" equities
13generally have a better reputation in the market. Category "T" is for technical listings only, the
simplest procedure for a company to appear in the regulated market. For companies newly
entering category "T", it will be easier to move to category "A" or "B" once a public offering
has been completed.
Businesses with their securities listed on a regulated market must continue to observe
certain governance rules and market transparency requirements.
The Hungarian Civil Code does not restrict the provision of upstream guarantees (non-
beneficial decisions or decisions which provide more risks to the company and may harm the
company's interests). However, in general the acts of shareholders or executive officers which
negatively affect creditors and cause the company to become insolvent may lead to full and
joint liability for such persons. Such actions may also be considered a criminal offence.
Laws relating to the charging of assets
The charging of corporate assets is permitted in principle, subject to certain limitations.
More precisely, a company may not grant loans, give undertakings or surety or pay financial
liabilities in connection with the subscription or acquisition of shares issued by the company
prior to the subscription or acquisition of shares. This restriction only applies to joint stock
companies (joint stock limited liability companies like Zrt. or Nyrt.). These provisions do not
restrict the acquisition of shares by employees of the relevant company (i.e. the target com-
pany) or employees of companies under the majority control of the company, and transac-
tions carried out by banks and other credit institutions in their ordinary course of business do
not fall under the restrictions.
Furthermore, the quotaholders/shareholders and directors of a limited liability company
and their close relatives may not enter into transactions for the acquisition, disposal, lease or
encumbrance of corporate assets without the prior approval of shareholders. No such manda-
tory provision applies to joint stock companies, although the quotaholders/shareholders may
include such a provision in the company's deed of foundation.
14/Employment
Employee relations
Hungarian labour relations are regulated by EU and statutory legislation, case law, collec-
tive bargaining agreements and individual employment agreements. Although case law has no
legally binding force, it plays a significant role when interpreting the statutory provisions and
therefore influences employment relations in a broad sense.
Employment regulations allow efficient contracting between employers and employees,
enabling labour market flexibility on the one hand and protecting employees from discrimina-
tory or unfair treatment by employers on the other hand. The protection for employees is also
reinforced by the employee-friendly attitude of the Hungarian labour courts.
In general trade unions are not as strong as in some other countries in Western Europe,
although in some sectors such as transport, education and public health they play a significant
role in labour relations. Strikes are not as common as in some other countries in continental
Europe.
The global financial crisis has significantly affected the Hungarian economy and has re-
sulted in an increase in the overall unemployment rate (climbing to a record high of 11.8% in
the first quarter of 2010). However, in the fourth quarter of 2015 this rate went down to 6.2%
according to the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. National minimum wages still lag behind
those in Western Europe: from 1 January 2016, the statutory minimum monthly wage for
workers without secondary education is HUF 111,000, and for workers with at least secondary
education HUF 129,000.
Employees in Hungary are generally highly skilled and educated, particularly in IT, engi-
neering, pharmacy, mathematics and physics. The number of employees with foreign lan-
guage skills is also increasing year-on-year.
Relevant labour and employment laws
The most important rules on labour relations are incorporated in Act I of 2012 on the La-
bour Code ( Labour Code ), which entered into force on 1 July 2012. The rules of the Labour
Code are in many ways similar to the legislation of other industrialised countries. They comply
with EU legislation and are applicable to all employment relations in Hungary.
Hungarian labour law – unless otherwise regulated by international private law, interna-
tional contracts or agreements (bilateral or multilateral) or ius cogens – applies to (i) all em-
ployment relationships where work is performed in Hungary, i.e. the Code applies to tempo-
rary projects on Hungarian territory and (ii) where the employee of a Hungarian employer
temporarily works outside Hungary.
15Contracts, agreements and implied terms governing em-
ployment relationships
Employment may only be established by a written contract, which must contain at least
the following information: the personal base salary, scope of work of the employee and the
place of work. Oral agreements concluded by the parties are also deemed to be valid unless
the employee notifies the employer of a disagreement within 30 days of their first day at
work.
As a general rule, the parties may only diverge from the provisions of the Labour Code if
the change is in the employee's favour. In some cases, however, deviating from the provisions
of the Labour Code is prohibited (e.g. termination notices must be in writing).
The employment term may be for an indefinite or a definite period; the latter may gener-
ally not exceed five years.
If an employer is bound by a local collective bargaining agreement, the relevant terms
must also be applied to the employees of the employer who are not members of the relevant
trade union.
Again, individual employment contracts may only differ from the rules of the applicable
collective agreement to the advantage of the employee. If an issue is regulated in both the
applicable collective agreement and the individual employment contract, the regulation that
is more advantageous for the employee will be deemed to apply.
The website of the Labour Ministry can be used to check whether there is an effective col-
lective bargaining agreement applicable to a certain employer.
There are also collective bargaining agreements applicable to entire business sectors and
employment relationships falling under the scope of the relevant sector collective bargaining
agreement.
Furthermore, in certain sectors, a sectoral collective agreement applies to all employers
active in that sector, whether or not they are members of a union.
Employees and management representation and corporate
transactions
Works councils may be elected at companies and their individual business units if they
have more than 50 employees. If less than 51 but more than 15 employees are employed at
the same company or one of its individual business units, a works representative may be
elected, and the representative has the same rights as the works council. Works councils and
works representatives are elected for a period of five years.
The works councils have a co-determination right concerning the use of welfare funds,
properties and institutions specified in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. In ad-
dition, works councils have a comprehensive right to express their opinion on issues such as
plans made by the employer affecting a material number of the employees (such as any reor-
16ganisation, restructuring, privatisation, modernisation of the employer, etc.), proposals on
employee training, proposals on annual holiday and new performance requirements, etc. In
such matters, however, no prior consent of the works council is required.
Employers must inform the works councils about certain other issues every half year. For
example they must inform works councils about: the basic economic situation of the employ-
er; any plans to change the business activities, any proposed changes to wages, the available
assets and the number and scope of duties of the employer, etc. Works councils are entitled
to request information from the employer relating to the social and economic interests of the
employees and their equal treatment. The employer cannot refuse to provide such infor-
mation. Any employer actions which breach the co-determination right of the works council
and the right to express their opinion are deemed void.
In the event of mass redundancies, the employer must hold consultations with the works
council before making its final decision on the redundancies. The employer must provide the
works council with the relevant information regarding the planned redundancies during the
consultation. The employer and the works council may enter into an agreement regarding the
redundancies, but the works council’s consent is not required.
In the event of legal succession of the employer (including a merger or demerger of com-
panies or a transfer of undertaking), the employer must also hold consultations with the
works council on the planned consequences of the legal succession that might affect employ-
ees. Again, the works council's consent is not required.
If the employer employs more than 200 employees full time, at least one third of the su-
pervisory board members of the employer must be elected from among the employees.
Termination of the individual employment contract
In general, an employment contract may be terminated by mutual consent, by termina-
tion, or by termination with immediate effect by the employer or the employee. The termina-
tion of an employment relationship must be in writing.
Termination with immediate effect can occur only if the employee:
 commits a serious breach of a material obligation arising from the employment with in-
tent or by gross negligence or
 exhibits behaviour which makes the continuation of the employment impossible – such as
causing injuries to the employer, being absent from work without a proper excuse or en-
dangering the economic interests of the employer.
The employee may terminate the unlimited term employment at any time by prior notice
without cause. The employer, however, may only terminate unlimited term employment by
termination due to the:
 employee's abilities
 employee's conduct in connection with the job
 employer's business operations.
17Reasons relating to the employee's abilities include, among other things, professional in-
adequacy, health reasons, but also psychological reasons, e.g. inability to get on with co-
workers and superiors. Reasons relating to the conduct of the employee include, among other
things, the violation of workplace and performance rules or the provisions of the employment
contract, refusal to carry out legitimate instructions from superiors and other behaviour vio-
lating the employer's business interests. Reasons relating to the employer's business opera-
tions include, for example, the restructuring or closing of the business operations.
No justification for termination by the employer needs to be given if the employee is be-
yond the statutory retirement age.
In the case of termination, the employment ends on the last day of the notice period. The
statutory notice period is 30 days. Depending on the number of years' continuous service, the
above period increases to a maximum of 60 days after 20 years of employment. The parties
may agree on specific notice periods in the employment contract. These, however, may not
be less than 30 days or more than six months.
In the case of termination by the employer, the employee has to be exempted from their
duties at least for the half the notice period.
Employees who have been employed at the same employer for at least three consecutive
years are entitled to severance pay upon termination by the employer, unless the employee is
a pensioner. The amount of the severance payment depends on the time spent in service
(minimum one month, maximum six months' "absentee fee").
Certain groups of employees enjoy special protection from termination (e.g. employees
on sick leave, employees on maternity leave, etc.).
In the case of fixed-term contracts, the employer may terminate the employment agree-
ment with immediate effect upon payment of one year's absentee fee or an absentee fee for
the remaining period if less than one year of the term of employment remains. In such cases,
no justification need be given for the termination. The employer may terminate the fixed-
term employment agreement: (i) if the employer is subject to bankruptcy proceedings ; (ii) in
connection with the employee's ability to work or (iii) if maintaining the employment relation-
ship becomes impossible due to a force majeure event.
In the case of an unlawful termination of the employment by the employer, the employee
has the right to contest the termination at court within 30 days of receipt of the termination
notice. Should the court establish that the termination was unlawful, the court may, on re-
quest by the employee, reinstate the employee in his former position. In the absence of such
a request, the employee may be awarded an amount equal to the absentee fee for the notice
period. Furthermore, irrespective of the claim for reinstatement, the employer is obliged to
reimburse the employee for his lost wages, any other allowances due and any further proven
damages.
18Redundancies and mass lay-offs
A mass lay-off occurs when an employer having (on average during the previous six
months):
 more than twenty but less than one hundred employees, terminates the employment of
at least ten employees
 more than one hundred but less than three hundred employees, terminates the employ-
ment of at least ten per cent of the employees or
 three hundred or more employees, terminates the employment of at least thirty employ-
ees within a 30-day period based on grounds connected to its business operations or by
mutual consent.
In the event of a mass lay-off, a strict procedure must be followed during which consulta-
tions must be held with the works council (in the course of an agreement can be concluded
between the employer and the works council on the terms of the redundancy) and the na-
tional employment agency must be notified of the relevant information on the planned re-
dundancies.
Foreign employees: work permits and residency permits
Generally, foreign citizens require an employment permit and a residence permit in order
to work legally in Hungary. The employer is entitled to launch the process for the employment
permit on behalf of an employee at the competent employment agency. Obtaining a work
permit generally takes one month, depending on the conditions. A permit is valid for a maxi-
mum term of two years and can be extended for an extra two years. There is a small fee.
No permits are required for EU/EEA citizens and refugees or persons holding resident sta-
tus in Hungary.
If no permit is required for employment, the competent national employment agency
must be notified of the employment by the production of certain information and the em-
ployee must obtain a registration card.
For EU/EEA citizens, no residency permit is required; however, a registration card must be
obtained if they spend more than three months in Hungary. For non-EU/EEA citizens, a resi-
dency permit is required. Generally, obtaining such a permit takes 30–40 days.
An EU "blue card" is a permit for high-educated employees from third countries entitling
the employee to reside and be employed inside any Member State.
19/Economy & Government
Hungary has a medium-sized economy and it is structurally, politically and institutionally
open. Hungary is in Central Europe and is part of the European Union's single market. Like
most Eastern European economies, the Hungarian economy experienced market liberalisation
in the early 1990s as part of the transition from socialist economy to market economy. Hunga-
ry has been a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD ) since 1995, a member of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) since 1996, and a
member of the European Union ( EU) since 2004.
Restrictions/regulations
There are no general restrictions on foreign investments. In certain sectors (e.g. real
property), however, licences may be required. In the case of takeovers, mergers or acquisi-
tions, the approval of the competition authority may be required under competition law.
There are no exchange control or currency regulations in Hungarian law.
Regarding state subsidies, on the one hand Hungary is entitled to approximately €40 bil-
lion from EU funds during the period of 2014–2020, 60% of which will be spent on developing
the Hungarian economy and focusing on R&D&I projects and investments of SMEs, according
to the Government's plans. These incentives are offered to foreign investors in the form of
tenders including the targeted project parameters.
On the other hand, the following main national funded incentive programs are available
for foreign investors:
 VIP cash grant (granted by the individual decision of the Government)
 job creation subsidy (cash grant granted by the individual decision of the Government)
 development tax allowance (exemption from the corporate tax to be paid by a company)
 training subsidy
 subsidy granted for the establishment or development of vocational training centres.
20/Taxation
Tax residency
Resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on their worldwide income.
An individual is deemed to be a resident if they are:
 a Hungarian citizen (except where they have another citizenship and has no permanent or
temporary residence in Hungary)
 a natural person who is present in Hungary for at least 183 days in the relevant calendar
year
 a national of another country or stateless person residing in Hungary if the person is pre-
sent in Hungary for at least 183 days in the relevant year
 a person whose only permanent residence is in Hungary
 centre of vital interests is in Hungary (as determined by family ties and business rela-
tions), if they have no permanent residence in Hungary or elsewhere
 a person whose temporary residence is in Hungary, if their centre of vital interests is un-
known and if they have no permanent residence in Hungary.
Non-resident individuals are subject to personal income tax on Hungarian-source income
if the place of gainful activity is in Hungary or if the income is taxable in Hungary pursuant to
an international agreement or treaty. Hungarian-source income includes income from being a
senior officer or supervisory board member of a legal entity registered in Hungary, and divi-
dends and interest received from Hungarian-registered businesses.
Income tax and social security contributions
Tax resident employees must pay personal income tax of15%.
The tax rate for healthcare contribution is 7% (in kind at 4%, monetary at 3%), a labour
fund (the amount paid is used to help the unemployed sector of the country capable of work-
ing to contribute to the possibility of their future employment) contribution at 1.5% and pen-
sion contribution at 10%.
Non-tax resident employees pay the same taxes and contributions as tax resident em-
ployees but only on Hungarian-source income.
Employers must pay a social contribution of 27%, and a vocational training contribution at
1.5% calculated on the employee's gross monthly wage.
Business vehicles
A business vehicle is tax resident if it is incorporated and registered under Hungarian law.
Foreign legal entities are deemed resident if their place of management is located in Hungary.
A business vehicle is non-tax resident if it is not incorporated and registered under Hun-
garian law but carries out business operations through branches in Hungary.
21Tax-resident companies generally pay corporate income tax of 19% on their worldwide
income. The corporate income tax rate is only 10% up to a positive tax base of HUF 500 mil-
lion (€1.85 million).
VAT is payable at 27% on supplies of goods and services. Certain goods and services listed
in the annexes to the VAT Act are subject to special rates of 5% or 18%, as applicable.
Non-tax resident business vehicles are subject to corporate tax at the same rate as tax
resident businesses but only in respect of income from business activities conducted through
a permanent establishment located in Hungary.
Corporate shareholders are not subject to tax on dividends declared in favour of them, ir-
respective of their residency.
Individual shareholders must pay income tax at 15% on dividends received, unless a dou-
ble tax treaty applies. A corporate shareholder does not have to pay income tax on dividends
received, unless a double tax treaty applies.
The same taxes apply to IP royalties paid as for interest.
Thin capitalisation rules
Thin capitalisation rules apply if the company subject to corporate income tax has obliga-
tions in respect of outstanding loans, outstanding debt securities offered privately or an over-
drawn account.
Under Hungarian thin capitalisation rules, pre-tax profits must be adjusted by adding a
pro rata portion of all interest paid on any of the above obligations that exceed three times
the company's equity capital, with the exception of interest paid to financial institutions
(which are not affiliates). This means that for example in the event that a loan is granted by
the parent company to the Hungarian entity and this loan exceeds the Hungarian Kft's equity
multiplied by three, then the payable interest which falls on the loan exceeding the above lim-
it (i.e. three times the equity of the Hungarian entity) will not be deductible for tax purposes.
Profits of a foreign subsidiary
Companies deemed to be controlled foreign companies are:
1. foreign-resident entities or
2. entities deemed as foreign-resident on account of their place of management, and which
either:
a) have a Hungarian-resident beneficial owner on at least 183 days of the calendar year
or
b) derive more than 50% of their revenues from Hungarian sources in the tax year and
where the effective tax, equivalent to Hungarian corporate income tax, paid by the for-
eign company is:
 below 10% of the company's taxable profits for that accounting period or
22 zero, because the company has a zero or negative tax base, despite making prof-
its for that period.
No CFC rules apply to companies with a registered office or resident status in an EU or
OECD Member State or in a treaty country where the company carries out genuine economic
activities.
The taxable profits of the Hungarian company must be increased by an amount equal to
the controlled foreign company's after-tax profits as at the last day of the tax year less any
dividends paid to its shareholders, provided that the Hungarian shareholder controls at least
25% of the votes or shares or has a controlling interest in the controlled foreign company and
no Hungarian-resident individual holds any interest in that Hungarian-resident shareholder.
Transfer pricing rules
If two or more companies are deemed to be affiliated companies under the Act on Corpo-
rate Tax and Dividend Tax and do not use arm's length prices in the course of their dealings,
the pre-tax profits of the affiliated companies are adjusted to reflect the arm's length price.
The arm's length price is generally determined using the comparable price, the resale
price, the cost plus, the transactional net margin or the profit split methods.
Companies qualifying as small or medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are not required to
apply the above transfer pricing rules to long-term agreements concluded with an affiliated
company, established for the purpose of joint purchases and sales, in which the total voting
rights held by such SME exceed 50%.
Companies not qualifying as SMEs on the last day of the tax year must record the arm's
length price, the method used to determine the arm's length price and the facts and circum-
stances supporting such price until the date of filing their corporate tax returns.
Imports and exports
Exports are subject to zero VAT. Imports are subject to VAT at the applicable rates. The
relevant EC Directives are implemented.
Double tax treaties
Hungary has double tax treaties with all of the original EU Member States and most of the
newly joined EU Member States.
23/Dispute R esolution
Court process
In Hungary, the civil court system has four levels: local courts, regional courts (in Buda-
pest the Budapest Capital Regional Court), regional courts of appeal and the Curia. In civil law
cases the local courts or regional courts have jurisdiction at first instance. Regional courts deal
with cases where the value of the claim exceeds HUF 30 million (approximately €100,000).
Court decisions can in general be appealed and will be heard by the relevant higher court.
In Hungarian civil procedure, legal disputes begin with the filing of a written statement of
claim, including supporting facts and evidence. The court hears the statements of the parties
and the evidence filed, which can include witness testimonies, expert opinions and other ma-
terial evidence. In Hungary, civil lawsuits usually last for several months. Representation by an
attorney is mandatory if the value of the claim exceeds HUF 30 million (approximately
€100,000) and in other cases where the regional courts have jurisdiction in the first instance.
There is no jury trial in Hungary. Judges decide both factual and legal questions and are
fully trained lawyers. Generally, there is a single judge at first instance (in certain cases ac-
companied by two civil assessors) and a panel of three judges at second instance. The Curia
consists of three or five judges, depending on the complexity of the case.
Pre-trial disclosure or class/group actions are not recognised in Hungarian procedural law.
As a general rule, all legal fees of the successful party must be reimbursed by the unsuccessful
party.
Arbitration
In addition to the ordinary court system, arbitration is possible in certain circumstances.
Parties to a contract may agree to submit to the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal instead of
an ordinary court. If so, ordinary courts will have no jurisdiction with regard to the dispute.
Arbitration is frequently used by business entities.
The main permanent arbitral tribunals in Hungary are the three Permanent Courts of Ar-
bitration (for Financial and Capital Markets, Telecommunications and the Energy Industry) and
the Court of Arbitration attached to the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The detailed rules, fees and costs of arbitration proceedings are set out in the rules of
procedure of each arbitral tribunal.
Hungary recognises and enforces foreign arbitral awards.
24/Competition
The most important source of Hungarian competition law is Act No. LVII of 1996 on the
prohibition of unfair market practices and restraints of competition ( Competition Act ). The
Competition Act sets out the key provisions concerning:
 the prohibition of restrictive agreements and concerted practices between undertakings
("anti-competitive agreements")
 the prohibition of abuses of a dominant position ("abuse of dominant position") and
 provisions on the control of mergers between undertakings ("merger control").
Anti-competitive agreements
Like European law, section 11(1) of the Competition Act prohibits agreements and con-
certed practices between undertakings as well as decisions by associations of undertakings
which aim to or have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition. Certain
practices are set out in the Competition Act in a (non-exhaustive) list of prohibited measures,
for example, the fixing of prices and conditions; the restriction and control of production, dis-
tribution, technical development and investments; the allocation and limitation of access to
supply sources and customers; the obstruction of market access and the discrimination of cus-
tomers or suppliers as regards price and sales conditions.
De minimis exemption: The prohibition of restrictive agreements does not extend to
agreements of minor significance, i.e. if the parties to the agreement have a joint market
share below 10% during the term of the agreement. The fixing of prices and the allocation of
markets, however, are still prohibited regardless of market share.
Block exceptions: The Hungarian Government is entitled to exempt certain groups of
agreements and concerted practices from the above prohibition if – similar to Article 1(3) of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union – the agreement contributes to improv-
ing the production or distribution of goods and services, promotes technical or economic pro-
gress or advances environmental protection or competitiveness, while allowing consumers or
customers a fair share of the resulting benefit and not imposing restrictions on the undertak-
ings concerned that are more than necessary to achieve those objectives and not eliminating
competition in respect of a substantial part of the affected products. Accordingly, various
governmental regulations provide block exemptions for vertical agreements relating to the
repair of cars, insurance agreements, agreements on research and development and the
transfer of technology. The Hungarian regulations are only applicable if the agreements do
not affect the Common Market (in which case they would be governed by the equivalent Eu-
ropean regulations).
Special exemptions: Special regulations may be applicable in the agricultural sector,
where the ministry in charge may establish that reasonable justifications exist to exempt an
25agreement from the applicable competitive regime. Also, in the agricultural sector, the com-
petition authority may oblige the parties concerned to bring their commercial practices in line
with the applicable competition regime, prior to imposing fines.
Participants in anti-competitive agreements may apply for leniency under the leniency
policy set out in the Competition Act. The first participant to inform the Competition Authority
about the anti-competitive agreements and provide satisfactory evidence of its existence and
participants may receive amnesty. The second, third or fourth participants may receive reduc-
tions in the fine the Competition Authority might impose on them.
Abuse of dominant position
Hungarian competition law also prohibits the abuse of a dominant position by an under-
taking. The Competition Act provides a non-exhaustive list of business practices which are
considered abusive, such as applying unfair prices and sales conditions; requesting unreason-
able benefits for the company against the customer (typically excessive costs for a service)
and imposing disadvantageous conditions upon customers; restricting production, distribution
and technical development to the detriment of consumers and customers; refusing or with-
holding goods from the market with the purpose of increasing their price or to obtain other
unreasonable advantages; discriminating arbitrarily between customers in similar business
dealings; applying unreasonably low prices which are not justified by increased efficiency; and
restricting and obstructing entry into the market by other undertakings, etc.
In contrast to certain other jurisdictions, the Competition Act does not set out a specific
market share threshold above which an undertaking is considered to have a dominant posi-
tion. Instead, the existence of a dominant position is determined in each particular case, tak-
ing into account the financial, technical and legal barriers and risks associated with entering or
leaving the market, the financial resources of the undertaking concerned and the structure of
the affected market and, in particular, competitors' market shares and their conduct as well as
the economic influence exerted by the undertaking concerned on the affected market.
Merger control
The Competition Act also regulates the procedure for controlling mergers between com-
panies. If the turnover thresholds of the Competition Act are met and the merger does not fall
within the jurisdiction of the European Commission, a merger between undertakings will re-
quire the Hungarian Competition Authority's ( HCA – Gazdasági Versenyhivatal) prior approval.
Hungarian merger control also extends to mergers between foreign companies if the Hungari-
an market is affected. Hungarian merger control is mandatory and supervisory, so if a merger
is completed without prior clearance by the HCA, the undertakings concerned may be severely
fined. Further, the HCA may also order the breakup of the merged undertaking if the merger
would have not qualified for clearance.
The material test in Hungarian merger control is a combination of the "significant lessen-
ing of competition" test which is meant to point out the possible changes in the relative
26strength of the competition on the affected market together with the "dominance" test, i.e.
the creation or strengthening of a dominant position in the affected market.
Penalties and fines
Breaches of the Competition Act may be subject to fines from HCA. The maximum fine is
10% of the undertaking's turnover in the previous business year.
Furthermore, anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices in connection with
public procurement procedures are considered a criminal offence and individuals could face
imprisonment for up to five years.
Private enforcement
Hungarian legislation recognises the importance of privately enforcing damage claims
arising out of anti-competitive arrangements. Accordingly, the Competition Act contains cer-
tain rules which aim to reduce burdens for claimants. In particular, decisions by the HCA as
well as the European Commission are sufficient to establish an infringement in the context of
a follow-on damages action. Furthermore, the Competition Act provides a presumption (re-
buttable for both the claimant and defendant) that a hard-core cartel resulted in a price in-
crease of 10% in order to facilitate damages calculations, and thus eases the burden of proof
regarding the damage caused by the cartel.
27/Intellectual P roperty
Intellectual property rights can be divided into two categories: industrial property rights
and copyright. Industrial property rights include patents, trademarks, designs, plant variety,
utility model and topography protection, as well as the protection of geographical indications.
Copyright covers literary and artistic works as well as related rights protecting artists or eco-
nomic investors contributing to the dissemination of the works to the public (performers,
producers of phonograms, broadcasters).
How to obtain protection?
In order to obtain protection for industrial property, an official protection procedure must
be followed including registration in the Patent Register by the official body responsible for
the management of industrial property rights.
The protection of copyright does not require a registration procedure since copyright pro-
tection exists as soon as the work is created.
Extent of protection
Intellectual property creates exclusive rights which, similar to property rights, ensure pro-
tection against all others for the creators of intellectual works by recognising and safeguarding
their economic and moral rights.
Industrial property rights
Patent protection lasts for 20 years from the day on which the patent application is filed
and applies solely in the countries where the protection was granted.
A Hungarian patent may be obtained by national or European application or by an appli-
cation submitted within the framework of the Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT), provided that
the application and the invention comply with the relevant statutory requirements.
Trademark protection lasts for 10 years from the date of filing the application. However,
protection may be extended by further 10-year periods at the registered owner's request.
As a fundamental rule, the author's rights are protected for his lifetime and 70 years af-
terwards. After the death of the author, the rights may be exercised by the author's heirs. In
the case of works created by joint authors, cinematographic creations and when the author
cannot be identified, the length of protection is determined in a different way.
An author may license the use of his work in return for consideration (the "copyright" it-
self is not transferable, only the use of it). The legal provisions concerning licence agreements
are found in the Copyright Act. There are two basic rules that must be followed in any licence
agreement: (i) the exploitation rights cannot be licensed for an indefinite period of time and
(ii), the specific exploitation right must be set out in the agreement. The Copyright Act regu-
lates publishing agreements and licence agreements concerning software and cinematograph-
28ic creations as further special types of agreements. Besides copyright provisions, the provi-
sions of the Civil Code on agreements must also be applied to licence agreements.
Enforcement
The Copyright Act and other statutes set out a large variety of ways to enforce intellectual
property rights. If an infringement of rights has occurred, the rightsholder may seek a remedy
under civil or criminal law (e.g. plagiarism, infringement of copyright and certain rights related
to copyright, compromising or defrauding the integrity of technological measures for the pro-
tection of copyright and certain rights related to copyright, falsifying data related to copyright
management, violation of industrial design rights) or initiate the customs protection, i.e. sei-
zure. The rightsholder may take legal action and claim (i) the Court's declaration of the in-
fringement; (ii) cessation of the infringement; (iii) compensation from the infringer; (iv) sur-
render of any enrichment obtained through the infringement; (v) communication of
information concerning the infringement; (vi) seizure of the means used for the infringement
and of infringing products; (vii) measures by the customs authorities to prevent free circula-
tion of infringing goods; and (viii) damages.
29/Marketing A greements
Agency agreements
In Hungary, agency agreements are governed by the Civil Code, which implements Di-
rective 86/653/EEC on self-employed commercial agents.
The primary obligation of a commercial agent is to negotiate agreements on the sale of
goods or otherwise concerning goods on behalf of his principal. It should be noted, however,
that a commercial agent acts as an independent contractor, rather than an employee. Gener-
ally, a commercial agent is not authorised to conclude agreements, but the parties may agree
otherwise. The principal is obliged to pay remuneration for the activities of the commercial
agent and provide the agent with the necessary documentation and materials.
The parties to an agency agreement are entitled to stipulate a restraint of trade clause.
Such a clause is valid only if it is concluded in writing, lasts for not more than two years after
termination of the agency agreement, specifies the remuneration and relates to the scope of
activity covered by the agency relationship in the contract.
Distribution agreements
Only basic elements of distribution agreements are regulated by the Hungarian Civil Code.
The Civil Code contains model clauses which apply by virtue of law to all distribution agree-
ments, including supply of products or of services. However, deviation from the model clauses
is possible in all cases. The key model clauses are described below:
 Protection of good reputation: According to the new Civil Code the distributor is obliged
to protect the good reputation of the supplier
 Instructions & control: The supplier is entitled to instruct the distributor and control the
performance of the distributor. However, if the instructions given by the supplier are un-
reasonable or inappropriate, the distributor is obliged to warn it, and any damage result-
ing from maintaining the instructions despite the warning will be the liability of the sup-
plier.
Franchising
Franchising agreements are regulated by the Hungarian Civil Code. With regard to fran-
chising agreements, the Civil Code contains model clauses which apply by virtue of law to all
franchising agreements. However, deviation from the model clauses is possible in all cases. In
the following the key model clauses are described:
 The franchisor is required to ensure that the franchisee has ongoing and uninterrupted
access to the use, utilisation and exploitation rights that are required for running the
franchise during the full term of the contract. The franchisee is required to take measures
to protect the know-how placed at its disposal.
30 Supply obligation: If the franchisor is obliged to supply the franchisee with the goods to
be sold or to supply basic materials for the production of goods and the franchisor fails to
fulfil the franchisee's order, the franchisee will be entitled to obtain the goods or the
basic materials from other sources.
 Protection of good reputation: The franchisee is obliged to protect the good reputation of
the franchisor.
 Instructions & control: The franchisor is entitled to instruct the franchisee and monitor
the franchisee's performance. However, if the instructions given by the franchisor are un-
reasonable or inappropriate, the franchisee is obliged to warn him and any damage re-
sulting from maintaining the instructions despite the warning will be the liability of the
franchisor.
It should be noted that competition and anti-trust restrictions apply in the case of fran-
chise agreements, as they are subject to the Act against Restrictions on Competition and EU
competition law with the exceptions under the "Pronuptia" ruling of the ECJ.
31/E-commerce
The key Hungarian law on e-commerce is the Act on Electronic Commerce and Infor-
mation Society Services, Act CVIII of 2001 ( E-Commerce Act ).
The E-Commerce Act regulates "information society services" rendered from Hungary or
directed from abroad to Hungary. The E-Commerce Act has a wide scope and applies to a very
wide variety of electronic services provided at a distance (particularly e-commerce services).
With regard to e-commerce contracts, the Act sets out conditions which must be followed
in the course of the provision of e-commerce services. Contracts entered into by means of
simple electronic correspondence (i.e. email and related technologies) are excluded from
these legal provisions and in the case of non-consumer e-commerce contracts, parties can
derogate from these conditions.
In addition to the above, the E-Commerce Act contains special provisions on
e-advertisements.
The Hungarian Decree on Consumer Contracts (Decree No 45/2014) – implementing
EU Directive 2011/83/EU – applies to consumer distance selling contracts. Non-consumer con-
tracts are generally exempted from the protective measures of this decree. The decree pro-
tects the interests of consumers by provisions such as the statutory cancellation right for con-
sumers without prior notice within 14 days of contracting or delivery, subject to further
conditions beyond the scope of this booklet.
The Hungarian Act on E-signatures (Act XXXV of 2001) sets out the statutory conditions
for using authorised e-signatures in certain circumstances, such as company registration pro-
cedures. Where the law requires a statement to be put in writing, an electronic document
furnished with an advanced security e-signature will have an identical effect.
32/Data P rotection
The Privacy Act (Act No CXII of 2011 on Informational Self-Determination and Freedom of
Information ( Privacy Act )) contains the key principles with regard to the authorised processing
of personal data. According to this key principles, personal data (meaning in broad terms all
data related in some way to data subjects, i.e. natural persons) may only be processed (i) with
the prior consent of the data subjects or (ii) in limited cases with the prior authorisation by
law. Since Hungarian law provides for statutory rights to process personal data only in limited
cases (see point (ii) above), the data subject's consent must be obtained in most cases.
One of the important provisions of the Privacy Act is that personal data may also be pro-
cessed without the prior consent of the data subject, provided that it is impossible or requires
disproportionate effort to obtain the data subject's consent. However, this exemption is only
applicable if data processing is necessary (i) for the data controller to comply with a legal obli-
gation, or (ii) for the data controller to assert its legitimate interests and such interests are not
overridden by fundamental privacy principles. Further, if personal data has been collected and
processed on the basis of a data subject's consent, such data may continue to be processed
even if the data subject revokes his or her consent, as long as either condition (i) or (ii) above
is met (note: the above provisions aim to implement Article 7c) and f) of Directive 95/46/EC).
It should be highlighted in this respect that data subjects must be informed about all rele-
vant aspects of the processing of their data because informed consent is required. This also
means that even if the data subject has provided prior consent, personal data may only be
processed within the scope of the actual and agreed data collection activity.
The Privacy Act established a new Data Protection Supervisory Authority ( DPA ) replacing
the previous Data Commissioner. The new authority has an increased scope of activity, such
as powerful investigative authority and the right to impose fines.
Significant changes were introduced in the field of data protection in 2015. The Hungarian
Parliament has amended the Privacy Act. The most important amendments of the Privacy Act
are described below.
A new tool, the binding corporate rules ( BCRs ), has been introduced in the amendment.
BCRs are intra-group company global privacy policies which set out standard internal proce-
dures and comply with EU data protection requirements. According to the new rules Hungari-
an companies and multinational company groups with Hungarian subsidiaries may – subject
to completing the approval procedure before the DPA – rely on BCRs when transferring per-
sonal data with their group. The approval procedure takes 60 days and the administrative fee
is HUF 266,000 (approximately €900).
In order to help individuals inform on any wrongdoings involving their personal data and
to facilitate DPA investigations, all data controllers are required to maintain a register of data
33breaches for at least five years. It is not necessary, however, to notify the authority of such
breaches.
The upper limit of monetary fines that may be imposed by the DPA has been increased to
HUF 20 million (approximately €65,000).
Several other acts (decrees) contain additional data protection provisions. For example,
personal data collected for the purposes of direct marketing and research is regulated by
Act CXIX of 1995. Also, the E-Commerce Act (see above) contains special data protection pro-
visions.
A gross infringement of data protection provisions may in some cases lead to criminal lia-
bility and can constitute a criminal offence (the relevant legal provisions are found in the Hun-
garian Criminal Code).
34/Product L iability
Product liability is now mainly regulated by the Civil Code implementing Directive 85/374/
EEC). The Civil Code provides that the manufacturer of the defective product is liable for dam-
age caused by the product defect and allows only few defences, e.g. the manufacturer did not
put the product into circulation, the product was not manufactured or distributed in the
course of the manufacturer's business or the defect could not be discovered at the time the
product was put into circulation according to the scientific and technical knowledge. A prod-
uct is defective if it fails to provide the level of safety generally expected. The term "manufac-
turer" is defined widely, and covers manufacturers in different phases of production. Apart
from the person attaching their name/trademark, the importer or the distributor can be held
liable. Examples of damage which may be subject to compensation are: damage resulting in
death, bodily injury or health damage. Property damage, other than damage to the defective
product itself, exceeding the equivalent of €500 in the Hungarian currency is recoverable if
the other property is of a type ordinarily intended for private use or consumption and was
usually used by the injured person for such purposes.
Product liability claims can be made under contract and tort law or other claims stipulat-
ed by law, in addition those under the Civil Code.
The general rules on product safety, applying to products that are intended for or made
accessible to consumers are set out in Act CLV of 1997 (on Consumer Protection ( CPA), im-
plementing Directive 2001/95/EC) and Act LXXXVIII of 2012. In addition, specific safety rules
apply to certain product groups, e.g. pharmaceuticals under Act XCV of 2005 and Decree
No. 52/2005 of the Minister of Healthcare.
The CPA and Act LXXXVIII of 2012 establish public law duties for the manufacturers of
consumer products, e.g. marking the product with appropriate labels, monitoring product
safety on a regular basis, investigating complaints raised in connection with product safety
and withdrawing or recalling the product from the market.
Non-compliance with product safety requirements can be punished by the competent
market surveillance authorities. Non-compliance with the CPA may be enforced by ordering
the withdrawal or recall of the unsafe product or by levying fines.
35/Bribery & Corpo rate C rime
Bribery is punishable under Act C of 2012 on the Hungarian Criminal Code, either commit-
ted in the public or the private sector, or committed actively or passively. Bribery may give
rise to imprisonment for between one and five years (in certain qualified cases up to ten
years). Criminal liability attaches to both the bribery of civil servants as well as directors and
employees of companies and associations. Bribing directors and employees of foreign compa-
nies as well as civil servants of foreign countries and organisations also qualifies as a crime.
Note that criminal liability attaches to the active conduct of bribing any of the above or re-
questing a bribe or another advantage. This also applies to the passive acceptance of, and the
agreement with, another person's demand for such bribe.
The European Money Laundering Directive has been incorporated into Hungarian law by
Act CXXXVI of 2007 on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism
(Money Laundering Act ). According to the provisions of the Money Laundering Act, compa-
nies in the financial sector, auditors, tax advisors, attorneys, notaries, casino operators and
traders of precious metals have to identify their customers and monitor and report suspicious
transactions. Failing to comply with the above reporting obligation qualifies as a criminal of-
fence and may give rise to up to two years imprisonment.
Assisting or participating in transactions relating to money laundering activities is also
deemed a criminal offence and may result in imprisonment for up to eight years.
In general, only acts of individuals are subject to criminal liability, and thus only individu-
als may be subject to criminal punishments relating to their criminal liability. Certain criminal
measures, however, can be made against companies as well if the crime – committed by a di-
rector, supervisory board member, employee or member etc. in their scope of duties – aimed
to obtain any kind of advantage for the company. These kinds of criminal measures against
companies can range from imposing a fine or restriction of activity to their compulsory termi-
nation.
36/Real E state
Based on the provisions of Act CXXII of 2013 on Transactions in Agricultural and Forestry
Land, Hungarian or foreign entities and non-EU nationals are not allowed to acquire owner-
ship of agricultural land, whereas EU nationals may now acquire agricultural land if they meet
the requirements set forth in the Act.
Foreign individuals and legal entities registered in the European Union may own any oth-
er real property without any further restrictions.
Acquisition of real estate by foreign individuals and legal entities registered outside the
European Union is subject to the approval of the relevant governmental body, as set out in
Government Decree No. 251/2014.
Freehold and leasehold are not recognised concepts in Hungarian law, i.e. ownership
rights are not limited in time.
Ownership of real estate may either be by co-ownership or sole ownership. In the case of
co-ownership, all owners have a theoretical ownership ratio in relation to the property which
is the basis of decision-making voting rights and costs.
Condominium ownership is a combination of the two forms: certain parts of the property
are solely owned, while other parts are co-owned by the owners.
With certain legal exceptions, the ownership of land and of the building on the land can-
not be separated.
Other interests may also be registered in relation to real property, for example:
 A "right of usufruct" is a right for a person to hold and use a certain asset and to benefit
from its products, without having the right to dispose of the property
 A "right of use" is a particular type of the right of usufruct, and, like the latter, is the right
for a person to hold and use a certain asset to the extent that it serves himself and his
family members
 An "easement" is the right to use a part of a real property of another without possessing
it. Easements require the existence of at least two parties.
Certain rights set out in Act CXLI of 1997 may only be validly created by registration in the
land register. These rights are: ownership based on transfer, asset management rights, use of
land, usufruct and the right of use, easement and mortgages based on contract.
This means that the transfer of ownership of a property is only effective if registered in
the land register.
For the purpose of valid registration, sale agreements need to be either countersigned by
a lawyer or prepared by a notary public in the form of a notarial deed.
37The transfer of real property is subject to transfer tax, payable by the purchaser.
The standard transfer tax rate is 4% on the part of the purchase price up to HUF 1 billion
(approximately €3.2 million) and 2% on the excess part, up to a maximum of HUF 200 million
(approximately €630,000).
For properties registered as apartments, the transfer tax is 4% of the difference between
the purchase prices of the apartment bought by the buyer and the previous apartment sold by
the buyer if the sale of the previous apartment is within one year of the purchase of the new
apartment.
The general rule is that the transfer of real property between legal entities is subject to
VAT, with certain exceptions defined by law.
Existing law is stated as it applied in January 2015.

Act LV of 2018  on the right of assembly  (as in force on 2 October  2018)  
This document has been produced for informational purposes only.  
5 Section 13  [Reasons for prohibiting an assembly]  
(1) Within 48 hours from receivi ng the notification, the assembly authority shall prohibit the 
holding of the assembly in the place or time specified in the notification if, according to the 
information available after the consultation, there are valid grounds to assume that the 
assembly  would pose an immediate, unnecessary and disproportionate risk to public safety or 
public order, or it would imply an unnecessary and disproportionate infringement of the rights 
and freedoms of others, and the protection of public safety, public order or the rights and 
freedoms of others cannot be guaranteed with a more lenient restricti on under paragraph (5).  
(2) Public safety shall be at risk in particular if the announcement or the assembly qualifies 
as a criminal offence or a call to commit a criminal offence.  
(3) Public safety shall also be at risk if the announcement or the assembly  
a) hinders the performance of an obligation undertaken regarding a person residing in 
Hungary and enjoying diplomatic or other immunity based on international law,  
b) is suitable to disturb the operation of the courts, or  
c) implies the impairment of the order of traffic.  
(4) The rights and freedoms of others shall be considered infringed in particular if the 
announcement or the assembly is suitable, due to the technical eq uipment used or the duration 
of it, to infringe  the rights of others to privacy and to family life, home, human dignity, the 
dignity of the Hungarian nation or of national, ethnic, racial or religious communities, or to 
restrict the right to free movement  or the right to freely choose the place of residence.  
(5) If the assembly authority does not prohibit holding the assembly, it may adopt a decision 
specifying for the organiser the conditions of holding the assembly, provided that it is 
necessary for the purpose of protecting public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms 
of others.  
Section  14 [Protection of the memory of the victims of national socialist and communist 
regimes]  
The assembly authority shall  also prohibit holding the assembly if  
a) the place of the assembly is a historical memorial site of national importance or the date 
of the assembly is a day that commemorates the victims of the inhuman crimes committed 
during the national socialist or the communist dictatorship, and  
b) accordi ng to the circumstances known at the time of the notification, there is an 
immediate risk of the assembly denying, doubting, trivialising  or trying to justify the fact of 
the inhuman crimes committed by the national socialist or communist dictatorship, and

1 Introduction  
Since 1990, the Hungarian economy is 
based on the principles of market economy 
and considers the freedom of economic 
competition as a priority. On such  basis, the 
regulation of business associations went 
through significant changes before evolving 
into its current form in Act V of 2013 on the 
Civil Code („ Civil Code ”). The current 
regulations entered into force on 15 March 
2014, replacing the provisions of Act IV of 
2006 on the business associations. Both 
pieces of legislation present a set of rules 
that is reliable and enables market 
participants to customise their companies 
to their respective needs.  
Generally, the Civil Code allows greater 
flexibility for the founders of Hungarian 
companies when determining the contents of the company’s establishing documents. 
This is so because, as opposed to the 
compulsory provisions of the previous 
regulations, deviation is generally allowed 
from the relevant rules o f the Civil Code, 
subject to certain limitations.  
The purpose of this summary is to outline a 
high -level overview of the main aspects that 
need to be considered in case of 
establishing a Hungarian business entity or 
acquiring a shareholding interest in a 
Hungarian company.  
2 Company forms in Hungary  
Companies may only be founded in the 
forms regulated in the Civil Code. The 
available company forms are the following:  
• general partnership (‘ kkt.’) 
• limited partnership (‘ bt.’) 
• limited liability company (‘ kft.’) 
• private company limited by shares (‘ zrt.’) 
While the liability of the members of 
partnerships for the debts of the company 
is, in general, unlimited, the other two 
company forms offer limited liability to the 
shareholders. As a consequence, in the 
business  practice, the ‘kft.’ and the ‘zrt.’ 
forms are the most popular forms of 
companies.  
According to the provisions of the Civil 
Code, establishing public companies limited 
by shares (‘ nyrt.’) upon foundation is no 
longer possible. Such companies may only 
be created by the transformation of private 
companies limited by shares since March 
2014.  

 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 4 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
As the kft. and zrt. forms are the most 
commonly used forms of business entities in 
Hungary, in the forthcoming sections we 
give a general overview and comparison of 
these two company types.  
3 Limited liability companies  
3.1 Company name  
The designation „ korlátolt felelősségű 
társaság ” (limited liability company) or 
its abbreviation „ kft.” must be indicated 
in the company’s name.  
3.2 Capital requirements  
The current minimum amount of the 
registered capital of a kft. is HUF 
3,000,000 (approximately EUR 10,000) 
which can be provided as a cash or as an 
in-kind contribution. An in -kind 
contribution may be any marketable 
thing of value or intellectual work, any 
intangible property or any  claim that is 
recognised by the debtor or that has 
been granted by a final and definitive 
court decision.  
The Civil Code has raised the minimum 
registered capital for limited liability 
companies from HUF 500,000 
(approximately EUR 1,700) to HUF 
3,000,000 for creditor protection 
reasons.  
The contribution of each member may 
not be less than HUF 100,000 
(approxi mately HUF 340). The Civil Code 
supersedes the previous regulation thus 
the contribution may not necessarily be 
divisible with HUF 10,000 since March 
2014.  
3.3 Membership rights  
The membership rights in limited 
liability companies are represented by 
so-called „business quotas”. The business quota is a notional concept as 
it is not embodied in physical or 
electronic form, but is solely registered 
in the members’ list of the company. 
The business quota represents 
membership rights and obligations of 
each member o f the company.  
Each quotaholder has one business 
quota. The size of the business quotas of 
the different members can, however, be 
different. Furthermore one business 
quota may be held by more than one 
quotaholder. In such case, it is 
considered as a joint business quota and 
the relating rights may be exercised by 
the joint representative of the 
quotaholders.  
If not provided otherwise, the extent of 
voting rights, rights to dividend and 
other membership rights are linked to 
the capital contribution made by the 
respective quotaholder.  
3.4 Special rights  
Special rights can be attached to the 
business quota of any of the 
quotaholders. Such special right can, for 
instance, offer the quotaholder voting 
preference, dividend preference, 
liquidation proceed preference or other 
preferences relating to the transfer of 
business quotas. There are no 
limitations or restrictions on the extent 
of such special rights, they are merely 
subject to the agreement of the 
quotaholders.  
3.5 Transfer of ownership rights  
Business quotas are freely transferable 
among the members of the company. 
However, the members may decide on 
various restrictions relating to the 
transferability of the business quotas to 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 5 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
third parties, such as pre -emption rights 
or the requirement for the members’ 
meeting’s consent.  
Business quotas may be transferred via 
a written contract between the seller 
and the purchaser. The purchase of the 
business quota must be notified to the 
managing director of the company 
which, upon such notification, register 
the new quotaholder  in the members’ 
list of the company.  
3.6 Supreme body  
The supreme body of the limited liability 
company is called the members’ 
meeting which must be convened by the 
managing director.  
The members’ meeting has a quorum if 
at least half of the eligible votes ar e 
represented. If the articles of 
association permit so, the members’ 
meeting may be held by electronic 
means of communication. The decisions 
falling within the scope of the members’ 
meeting may also be made in a written 
form, without holding a meeting.  
Generally, the decisions of the 
members’ meeting are passed with 
simple majority of votes, although the 
Civil Code also requires that certain 
strategic decisions must be resolved 
with a qualified (75%) majority. The 
members may adopt higher majority 
requirem ents for certain decisions in the 
articles of association of the company.  
3.7 Executive officers  
The executive officers of a kft. are called 
managing directors. The managing 
directors are, generally, elected by the 
members’ meeting. The current 
regulations ena ble the companies to 
decide whether the managing directors should act individually concerning the 
operative day -to-day decisions of the 
company or to form a body of the 
managing directors. The Civil Code also 
allows legal entities and not just natural 
pers ons to be elected as managing 
directors.  
3.8 Supervisory board  
The election of a supervisory board is 
only mandatory if the number of full -
time employees of the limited liability 
company exceeds 200 on annual 
average.  
3.9 Auditor  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company employs more than 50 
employees.  
The auditor is elected by the supreme 
body of the company for a maximum 
term of 5 (five) calendar years starting 
from the date of the app ointment.  
4 Private companies limited by shares (zrt.)  
4.1 Company name  
The designation „ zártkörűen működő 
részvénytársaság ” (private company 
limited by shares) or its abbreviation 
„zrt.” must be indicated in the 
company’s name.  
4.2 Capital requirements  
The minimum amount of the registered 
capital is HUF 5,000,000 (approximately 
EUR 17,000) which can be provided as a 
cash or as an in -kind contribution. An in -
kind contribution may be any 
marketable thing of value or intellectual 
work, any intangible proper ty or any 
claim that is recognised by the debtor or 
that has been granted by a final and 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 6 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
definitive court decision. If any of the 
shareholders provides an in -kind 
contribution to the registered capital of 
the respective company, the actual 
value of such in -kind contribution must 
be certified in writing by an 
independent auditor.  
There are no restrictions on the nominal 
value of the shares.  
4.3 Membership rights  
The membership rights in a zrt. are 
represented by shares. The shares are 
considered as securities an d may exist in 
physical (printed) or in dematerialised 
form. In the latter case shares are 
recorded on the securities account of 
the shareholder.  
If not provided otherwise, the extent of 
voting rights, rights to dividend and 
other shareholder’s rights are linked to 
the nominal value of the share.   
4.4 Special rights  
Preferred shares may be issued by the 
company to its shareholders. The total 
nominal value of the preferred shares 
may currently not exceed 50% of the 
capital of the company. The Civil Code 
does no t set out such an exhaustive list 
of preferential rights, enabling the 
shareholders to resolve on issuing 
preferred shares with any desired 
preferential rights, without any 
restriction.  
In addition to preferred shares, other 
special types of shares (e.g. e mployee 
shares, interest bearing shares, 
redeemable shares, etc.) may be issued 
by the company.  4.5 Transfer of ownership rights  
Shares are freely transferable, however 
certain restrictions may be imposed on 
the transferability of the shares by the 
shareholder s. Such restrictions are only 
valid if indicated on the share certificate 
itself.  
Physical shares may be transferred by 
physical delivery, together with a written 
endorsement.  
Dematerialised shares are transferred 
via debiting and crediting the securities  
accounts of the respective shareholders.  
4.6 Supreme body  
The supreme body of a private company 
limited by shares is the general meeting 
which is convened by the board of 
directors or the chief executive officer.  
The general meeting has a quorum if at 
least half of the eligible votes are 
represented. If the statutes permit so, 
the general meeting may be held by 
electronic means of communication. 
The decisions falling within the scope of 
the general meeting may also be made 
in a written form, without hol ding a 
meeting.  
Generally, the decisions of the general 
meeting are passed with simple 
majority, although the Civil Code require 
that certain strategic decisions must be 
resolved with qualified (75%) majority. 
The shareholders may stipulate higher 
majority  requirements for certain 
decisions in the statutes.  
4.7 Executive officers  
The executive body of a private 
company limited by shares is its board of 
directors which consists of a minimum 
of three natural person members.  
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 7 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
If the statutes so provide, the company  
can elect a single chief executive officer 
instead of a board of directors.  
4.8 Supervisory board  
The election of a supervisory board is 
only mandatory if it is requested by the 
shareholders controlling at least five per 
cent of the total votes or if the numb er 
of full -time employees of the company 
exceeds 200 on annual average.  
4.9 Auditor  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company employs more than 50 
employees.  
The auditor is elected b y the supreme 
body of the company for a maximum 
term of 5 (five) calendar years starting 
from the date of the appointment.  
5 Documentation for company establishment  
In this section we give a practical overview 
of the required documents for the 
incorporation of a company in Hungary.  
5.1 Documents prepared by legal counsel 
and to be signed by the founders or the 
executive officers of the companies are:  
• constitutive document (Articles of 
association/Statutes/Deed of 
foundation – depending on the 
respective company form);  
• power of attorney given to the 
attorney representing the company 
in the court of registration 
procedure (this is an obligatory 
document as the company must be 
represented by an attorney or a legal 
counsel in the course of the court of 
registration p rocedure);  • declaration of acceptance of the 
executive officers/supervisory board 
members/auditor (the appointments 
will only become effective if the 
elected persons declare their 
acceptance);  
• specimen signature of the persons 
signing on behalf of the compa ny; 
• in case of a limited liability company: 
a members’ list indicating the 
members/quotaholders of the 
company and limitations on the 
transfer of the business quotas; and  
• other ancillary documents set forth 
by laws.  
5.2 Documents to be provided by the 
founders are:  
• in case the founder of the company 
is a foreign entity: the certificate of 
incorporation of the founder (such 
certificate must not be older than 3 
months and signing authority on 
behalf of the entity must be 
apparent from it) and its official  
translation;  
• declaration of the executive officer 
or documentary evidence on the 
valid use of the registered 
seat/branch office of the company;  
• verification of payment of the 
registered capital of the company – a 
bank certificate or the declaration of 
the executive officer of the company 
on the payment of the contributions; 
and 
• tax identification number of the 
quotaholders/shareholders and the 
executive officers – if individuals are 
reluctant to provide their home tax 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 8 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
number, a Hungarian tax number 
can be obtained.  
5.3 Furthermore, the verification on the 
payment of the obligatory procedural 
duty and the publication fee shall also 
be submitted to the Court of Registry. 
Starting from March 2017, however, the 
establishment of a kft. has become free 
of procedural duty enabling founders an 
even more cost -effective way to 
establish Hungarian companies.  
6 The establishment process  
A company is considered as formed, if it is 
entered into the register of companies. The 
date of incorporation of the company is 
considered t o be the date when the 
registration takes place. The company may 
start its operations as a „pre -company” as 
of the date of the countersignature of its 
constitutive document and engage in 
business operations after having received its 
tax identification code . 
A simplified registration procedure may be 
applied, if the company’s constitutive 
document is based on a standard form 
prescribed by the laws. The use of standard 
forms provides less flexibility but leads to 
lower registration fees and quicker 
registrati on. 
An estimated timeline of a company 
registration is the following:  
(i) day 0: all the required information on 
the company given to the attorney;  
(ii) between day 0 and day 4: preparation of 
the required documents by the 
attorney;  
(iii) between day 4 and day 11: signin g of 
the documents by the founders and 
executive officers; it is to be noted that 
some of the documents need to be notarised and apostilled (or attested by 
the Hungarian consulate) if signed 
outside Hungary;  
(iv) day 11: countersignature by the 
attorney;  
(v) day 12: filing the application with the 
competent Court of Registration;  
(vi) day 15: receipt of VAT number of the 
company; and  
(vii) between day 16 and day 35: registration 
of the company by the Court; it must be 
noted that the Court shall register the 
company within 1 business day of the 
receipt of its VAT number in case of a 
simplified procedure, otherwise the 
procedure can take 15 business day at 
most.  
7 Governance, Regulation and Ongoing 
Maintenance  
7.1 Accounting requirements  
The companies incorporated in Hungary 
need to comply with various Hungarian 
accounting and filing requirements.  
The Hungarian accounting rules are in line 
with EU and International Accounting 
Standards. Double -entry bookkeeping is 
required for limited liability companies and 
for companies limited by s hares.  
Act C of 2000 on accounting regulates the 
accounting, audit and reporting 
requirements and contains the rules for the 
financial statements to be prepared by the 
companies.  
The company needs to keep an on -going 
record on its financial status during the 
financial year. The company has to take into 
account the basic principles of accounting 
when preparing its records. Such basic 
principles contain rules for the invoices and 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 9 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
accounting documents issued or received 
and the method of the accounting.  
7.2 Repor ting requirements  
The company needs to prepare at the 
end of each financial year a financial 
statement. A company is entitled to 
prepare and submit a simplified 
financial statement if two of the three 
following conditions can be applied to 
the company: (i)  the company’s balance 
sheet total does not exceed HUF 1,200 
million (approximately EUR 3,871,000), 
(ii) its annual net turnover does not 
exceed HUF 2,400 million 
(approximately EUR 7,742,000) and (iii) 
the company employs less than 50 
employees in average . Companies not 
fulfilling the above requirements need 
to prepare and submit a business report 
in addition.  
Companies considered to be parent 
companies are required to prepare and 
submit consolidated reports.  
The companies’ financial statements 
need to be  uploaded to the Electronic 
Financial Statement Website and these 
documents are available to the general 
public.  
7.3 Audit requirements  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company emplo ys more than 50 
employees.  
7.4 Registers  
Hungarian companies need to maintain 
different registers themselves, e.g. 
register of the company’s members.  
 
 7.5 Annual return  
Hungarian companies need to submit 
concerning each financial year an annual 
return until 31 May of each calendar 
year if the financial year of the 
respective company is the same as the 
calendar year, otherwise, within 5 
months from the end of the financial 
year.  
7.6 Requirements for local 
shareholding/directors  
There are no requirements for local 
shareholding or directors, but in 
regulated sectors some restrictions may 
apply.  
7.7 Minority shareholders’ rights and 
protection  
The protection of minority interests is 
guaranteed in the Civil Code.  
The members (shareholders) of a 
company having at least 5% of  the 
voting rights can request that the 
meeting of the supreme body is 
convened. If the executive body does 
not comply with such request, the 
minority can enforce its right in the

1 Introduction  
Since 1990, the Hungarian economy is 
based on the principles of market economy 
and considers the freedom of economic 
competition as a priority. On such  basis, the 
regulation of business associations went 
through significant changes before evolving 
into its current form in Act V of 2013 on the 
Civil Code („ Civil Code ”). The current 
regulations entered into force on 15 March 
2014, replacing the provisions of Act IV of 
2006 on the business associations. Both 
pieces of legislation present a set of rules 
that is reliable and enables market 
participants to customise their companies 
to their respective needs.  
Generally, the Civil Code allows greater 
flexibility for the founders of Hungarian 
companies when determining the contents of the company’s establishing documents. 
This is so because, as opposed to the 
compulsory provisions of the previous 
regulations, deviation is generally allowed 
from the relevant rules o f the Civil Code, 
subject to certain limitations.  
The purpose of this summary is to outline a 
high -level overview of the main aspects that 
need to be considered in case of 
establishing a Hungarian business entity or 
acquiring a shareholding interest in a 
Hungarian company.  
2 Company forms in Hungary  
Companies may only be founded in the 
forms regulated in the Civil Code. The 
available company forms are the following:  
• general partnership (‘ kkt.’) 
• limited partnership (‘ bt.’) 
• limited liability company (‘ kft.’) 
• private company limited by shares (‘ zrt.’) 
While the liability of the members of 
partnerships for the debts of the company 
is, in general, unlimited, the other two 
company forms offer limited liability to the 
shareholders. As a consequence, in the 
business  practice, the ‘kft.’ and the ‘zrt.’ 
forms are the most popular forms of 
companies.  
According to the provisions of the Civil 
Code, establishing public companies limited 
by shares (‘ nyrt.’) upon foundation is no 
longer possible. Such companies may only 
be created by the transformation of private 
companies limited by shares since March 
2014.  

 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 4 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
As the kft. and zrt. forms are the most 
commonly used forms of business entities in 
Hungary, in the forthcoming sections we 
give a general overview and comparison of 
these two company types.  
3 Limited liability companies  
3.1 Company name  
The designation „ korlátolt felelősségű 
társaság ” (limited liability company) or 
its abbreviation „ kft.” must be indicated 
in the company’s name.  
3.2 Capital requirements  
The current minimum amount of the 
registered capital of a kft. is HUF 
3,000,000 (approximately EUR 10,000) 
which can be provided as a cash or as an 
in-kind contribution. An in -kind 
contribution may be any marketable 
thing of value or intellectual work, any 
intangible property or any  claim that is 
recognised by the debtor or that has 
been granted by a final and definitive 
court decision.  
The Civil Code has raised the minimum 
registered capital for limited liability 
companies from HUF 500,000 
(approximately EUR 1,700) to HUF 
3,000,000 for creditor protection 
reasons.  
The contribution of each member may 
not be less than HUF 100,000 
(approxi mately HUF 340). The Civil Code 
supersedes the previous regulation thus 
the contribution may not necessarily be 
divisible with HUF 10,000 since March 
2014.  
3.3 Membership rights  
The membership rights in limited 
liability companies are represented by 
so-called „business quotas”. The business quota is a notional concept as 
it is not embodied in physical or 
electronic form, but is solely registered 
in the members’ list of the company. 
The business quota represents 
membership rights and obligations of 
each member o f the company.  
Each quotaholder has one business 
quota. The size of the business quotas of 
the different members can, however, be 
different. Furthermore one business 
quota may be held by more than one 
quotaholder. In such case, it is 
considered as a joint business quota and 
the relating rights may be exercised by 
the joint representative of the 
quotaholders.  
If not provided otherwise, the extent of 
voting rights, rights to dividend and 
other membership rights are linked to 
the capital contribution made by the 
respective quotaholder.  
3.4 Special rights  
Special rights can be attached to the 
business quota of any of the 
quotaholders. Such special right can, for 
instance, offer the quotaholder voting 
preference, dividend preference, 
liquidation proceed preference or other 
preferences relating to the transfer of 
business quotas. There are no 
limitations or restrictions on the extent 
of such special rights, they are merely 
subject to the agreement of the 
quotaholders.  
3.5 Transfer of ownership rights  
Business quotas are freely transferable 
among the members of the company. 
However, the members may decide on 
various restrictions relating to the 
transferability of the business quotas to 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 5 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
third parties, such as pre -emption rights 
or the requirement for the members’ 
meeting’s consent.  
Business quotas may be transferred via 
a written contract between the seller 
and the purchaser. The purchase of the 
business quota must be notified to the 
managing director of the company 
which, upon such notification, register 
the new quotaholder  in the members’ 
list of the company.  
3.6 Supreme body  
The supreme body of the limited liability 
company is called the members’ 
meeting which must be convened by the 
managing director.  
The members’ meeting has a quorum if 
at least half of the eligible votes ar e 
represented. If the articles of 
association permit so, the members’ 
meeting may be held by electronic 
means of communication. The decisions 
falling within the scope of the members’ 
meeting may also be made in a written 
form, without holding a meeting.  
Generally, the decisions of the 
members’ meeting are passed with 
simple majority of votes, although the 
Civil Code also requires that certain 
strategic decisions must be resolved 
with a qualified (75%) majority. The 
members may adopt higher majority 
requirem ents for certain decisions in the 
articles of association of the company.  
3.7 Executive officers  
The executive officers of a kft. are called 
managing directors. The managing 
directors are, generally, elected by the 
members’ meeting. The current 
regulations ena ble the companies to 
decide whether the managing directors should act individually concerning the 
operative day -to-day decisions of the 
company or to form a body of the 
managing directors. The Civil Code also 
allows legal entities and not just natural 
pers ons to be elected as managing 
directors.  
3.8 Supervisory board  
The election of a supervisory board is 
only mandatory if the number of full -
time employees of the limited liability 
company exceeds 200 on annual 
average.  
3.9 Auditor  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company employs more than 50 
employees.  
The auditor is elected by the supreme 
body of the company for a maximum 
term of 5 (five) calendar years starting 
from the date of the app ointment.  
4 Private companies limited by shares (zrt.)  
4.1 Company name  
The designation „ zártkörűen működő 
részvénytársaság ” (private company 
limited by shares) or its abbreviation 
„zrt.” must be indicated in the 
company’s name.  
4.2 Capital requirements  
The minimum amount of the registered 
capital is HUF 5,000,000 (approximately 
EUR 17,000) which can be provided as a 
cash or as an in -kind contribution. An in -
kind contribution may be any 
marketable thing of value or intellectual 
work, any intangible proper ty or any 
claim that is recognised by the debtor or 
that has been granted by a final and 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 6 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
definitive court decision. If any of the 
shareholders provides an in -kind 
contribution to the registered capital of 
the respective company, the actual 
value of such in -kind contribution must 
be certified in writing by an 
independent auditor.  
There are no restrictions on the nominal 
value of the shares.  
4.3 Membership rights  
The membership rights in a zrt. are 
represented by shares. The shares are 
considered as securities an d may exist in 
physical (printed) or in dematerialised 
form. In the latter case shares are 
recorded on the securities account of 
the shareholder.  
If not provided otherwise, the extent of 
voting rights, rights to dividend and 
other shareholder’s rights are linked to 
the nominal value of the share.   
4.4 Special rights  
Preferred shares may be issued by the 
company to its shareholders. The total 
nominal value of the preferred shares 
may currently not exceed 50% of the 
capital of the company. The Civil Code 
does no t set out such an exhaustive list 
of preferential rights, enabling the 
shareholders to resolve on issuing 
preferred shares with any desired 
preferential rights, without any 
restriction.  
In addition to preferred shares, other 
special types of shares (e.g. e mployee 
shares, interest bearing shares, 
redeemable shares, etc.) may be issued 
by the company.  4.5 Transfer of ownership rights  
Shares are freely transferable, however 
certain restrictions may be imposed on 
the transferability of the shares by the 
shareholder s. Such restrictions are only 
valid if indicated on the share certificate 
itself.  
Physical shares may be transferred by 
physical delivery, together with a written 
endorsement.  
Dematerialised shares are transferred 
via debiting and crediting the securities  
accounts of the respective shareholders.  
4.6 Supreme body  
The supreme body of a private company 
limited by shares is the general meeting 
which is convened by the board of 
directors or the chief executive officer.  
The general meeting has a quorum if at 
least half of the eligible votes are 
represented. If the statutes permit so, 
the general meeting may be held by 
electronic means of communication. 
The decisions falling within the scope of 
the general meeting may also be made 
in a written form, without hol ding a 
meeting.  
Generally, the decisions of the general 
meeting are passed with simple 
majority, although the Civil Code require 
that certain strategic decisions must be 
resolved with qualified (75%) majority. 
The shareholders may stipulate higher 
majority  requirements for certain 
decisions in the statutes.  
4.7 Executive officers  
The executive body of a private 
company limited by shares is its board of 
directors which consists of a minimum 
of three natural person members.  
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 7 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
If the statutes so provide, the company  
can elect a single chief executive officer 
instead of a board of directors.  
4.8 Supervisory board  
The election of a supervisory board is 
only mandatory if it is requested by the 
shareholders controlling at least five per 
cent of the total votes or if the numb er 
of full -time employees of the company 
exceeds 200 on annual average.  
4.9 Auditor  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company employs more than 50 
employees.  
The auditor is elected b y the supreme 
body of the company for a maximum 
term of 5 (five) calendar years starting 
from the date of the appointment.  
5 Documentation for company establishment  
In this section we give a practical overview 
of the required documents for the 
incorporation of a company in Hungary.  
5.1 Documents prepared by legal counsel 
and to be signed by the founders or the 
executive officers of the companies are:  
• constitutive document (Articles of 
association/Statutes/Deed of 
foundation – depending on the 
respective company form);  
• power of attorney given to the 
attorney representing the company 
in the court of registration 
procedure (this is an obligatory 
document as the company must be 
represented by an attorney or a legal 
counsel in the course of the court of 
registration p rocedure);  • declaration of acceptance of the 
executive officers/supervisory board 
members/auditor (the appointments 
will only become effective if the 
elected persons declare their 
acceptance);  
• specimen signature of the persons 
signing on behalf of the compa ny; 
• in case of a limited liability company: 
a members’ list indicating the 
members/quotaholders of the 
company and limitations on the 
transfer of the business quotas; and  
• other ancillary documents set forth 
by laws.  
5.2 Documents to be provided by the 
founders are:  
• in case the founder of the company 
is a foreign entity: the certificate of 
incorporation of the founder (such 
certificate must not be older than 3 
months and signing authority on 
behalf of the entity must be 
apparent from it) and its official  
translation;  
• declaration of the executive officer 
or documentary evidence on the 
valid use of the registered 
seat/branch office of the company;  
• verification of payment of the 
registered capital of the company – a 
bank certificate or the declaration of 
the executive officer of the company 
on the payment of the contributions; 
and 
• tax identification number of the 
quotaholders/shareholders and the 
executive officers – if individuals are 
reluctant to provide their home tax 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 8 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
number, a Hungarian tax number 
can be obtained.  
5.3 Furthermore, the verification on the 
payment of the obligatory procedural 
duty and the publication fee shall also 
be submitted to the Court of Registry. 
Starting from March 2017, however, the 
establishment of a kft. has become free 
of procedural duty enabling founders an 
even more cost -effective way to 
establish Hungarian companies.  
6 The establishment process  
A company is considered as formed, if it is 
entered into the register of companies. The 
date of incorporation of the company is 
considered t o be the date when the 
registration takes place. The company may 
start its operations as a „pre -company” as 
of the date of the countersignature of its 
constitutive document and engage in 
business operations after having received its 
tax identification code . 
A simplified registration procedure may be 
applied, if the company’s constitutive 
document is based on a standard form 
prescribed by the laws. The use of standard 
forms provides less flexibility but leads to 
lower registration fees and quicker 
registrati on. 
An estimated timeline of a company 
registration is the following:  
(i) day 0: all the required information on 
the company given to the attorney;  
(ii) between day 0 and day 4: preparation of 
the required documents by the 
attorney;  
(iii) between day 4 and day 11: signin g of 
the documents by the founders and 
executive officers; it is to be noted that 
some of the documents need to be notarised and apostilled (or attested by 
the Hungarian consulate) if signed 
outside Hungary;  
(iv) day 11: countersignature by the 
attorney;  
(v) day 12: filing the application with the 
competent Court of Registration;  
(vi) day 15: receipt of VAT number of the 
company; and  
(vii) between day 16 and day 35: registration 
of the company by the Court; it must be 
noted that the Court shall register the 
company within 1 business day of the 
receipt of its VAT number in case of a 
simplified procedure, otherwise the 
procedure can take 15 business day at 
most.  
7 Governance, Regulation and Ongoing 
Maintenance  
7.1 Accounting requirements  
The companies incorporated in Hungary 
need to comply with various Hungarian 
accounting and filing requirements.  
The Hungarian accounting rules are in line 
with EU and International Accounting 
Standards. Double -entry bookkeeping is 
required for limited liability companies and 
for companies limited by s hares.  
Act C of 2000 on accounting regulates the 
accounting, audit and reporting 
requirements and contains the rules for the 
financial statements to be prepared by the 
companies.  
The company needs to keep an on -going 
record on its financial status during the 
financial year. The company has to take into 
account the basic principles of accounting 
when preparing its records. Such basic 
principles contain rules for the invoices and 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 9 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
accounting documents issued or received 
and the method of the accounting.  
7.2 Repor ting requirements  
The company needs to prepare at the 
end of each financial year a financial 
statement. A company is entitled to 
prepare and submit a simplified 
financial statement if two of the three 
following conditions can be applied to 
the company: (i)  the company’s balance 
sheet total does not exceed HUF 1,200 
million (approximately EUR 3,871,000), 
(ii) its annual net turnover does not 
exceed HUF 2,400 million 
(approximately EUR 7,742,000) and (iii) 
the company employs less than 50 
employees in average . Companies not 
fulfilling the above requirements need 
to prepare and submit a business report 
in addition.  
Companies considered to be parent 
companies are required to prepare and 
submit consolidated reports.  
The companies’ financial statements 
need to be  uploaded to the Electronic 
Financial Statement Website and these 
documents are available to the general 
public.  
7.3 Audit requirements  
The appointment of an auditor is only 
mandatory if the company’s yearly 
revenues exceed HUF 300 million or the 
company emplo ys more than 50 
employees.  
7.4 Registers  
Hungarian companies need to maintain 
different registers themselves, e.g. 
register of the company’s members.  
 
 7.5 Annual return  
Hungarian companies need to submit 
concerning each financial year an annual 
return until 31 May of each calendar 
year if the financial year of the 
respective company is the same as the 
calendar year, otherwise, within 5 
months from the end of the financial 
year.  
7.6 Requirements for local 
shareholding/directors  
There are no requirements for local 
shareholding or directors, but in 
regulated sectors some restrictions may 
apply.  
7.7 Minority shareholders’ rights and 
protection  
The protection of minority interests is 
guaranteed in the Civil Code.  
The members (shareholders) of a 
company having at least 5% of  the 
voting rights can request that the 
meeting of the supreme body is 
convened. If the executive body does 
not comply with such request, the 
minority can enforce its right in the 
court.  
Minority shareholders has various 
additional protective rights, such as they 
can request that an auditor examines 
the last financial statement of the 
company or a given act of the executive 
officers of the company from the last 
two years. Also, minority shareholders 
can enforce the claim of the company 
against its members ( shareholders), 
executive officers, supervisory board 
members or the appointed auditor of 
the company if the supreme body of the 
company decided not to do so, or the 
supreme body did not decide on this 
 [ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS ENTITY IN HUNGARY ] 10 
 
  ILN Corporate Group – Establishing a Business Entity Series   
  
point even though it was on the agenda 
of the meeting.  
8 Foreign Investment, Thin Capitalisation, 
Residency and Material Visa Requirements  
8.1 Any significant barriers to entry for an 
offshore company  
There are no general barriers to entry 
for offshore companies. Restrictions 
may apply in the sectors where a permit 
for the beginning of the company’s 
activity is required.  
8.2 Any capitalisation obligations  
The capital requirements for the limited 
liability company are set out under 
Section 3.2 of this summary and the 
capital requirement for private 
companies limited by sh ares are set out 
under Section 4.2.  
In case the company does not fulfil 
according to its balance sheet data the 
minimum capital requirement 
determined for its company form in two 
successive financial years, then the 
supreme body of the company needs to 
decide either on the provision of the 
necessary capital or the reorganisation 
to another company form.  
8.3 Any special business or investment visa 
issues  
The citizens of the European Economic 
Area countries do not need any permit 
to live and work in Hungary. Som e 
restrictions may apply to employees 
from Romania, Bulgaria or Croatia. Third 
country citizens need to apply for a 
residence permit and a work permit in 
order to live and work in Hungary.  
A third country citizen may apply for a 
Hungarian residence permit  for 
maximum 5 years if he/she can prove to own, or if a company in his/her majority 
ownership owns treasury bonds of a 
nominal value of at least EUR 250,000 
specifically issued by the Hungarian 
State for this purpose.  
8.4 Any restrictions on remitting funds out 
of the jurisdiction
